    "problem": "What is in the images?",
    "solution": "This is bulbasaur, and is a Grass/Poison-type Pokemon. Bulbasaur (Japanese: フシギダネ Fushigidane) is a dual-type Grass/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt evolves into Ivysaur starting at level 16, which evolves into Venusaur starting at level 32.\n\nAlong with Charmander and Squirtle, Bulbasaur is one of the three first partner Pokémon of Kanto available at the beginning of Pokémon Red, Green, Blue, FireRed, and LeafGreen.\nBulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. Small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis and from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.\n\nFirst partner Pokémon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers. Having been raised by humans from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokémon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. Bulbasaur have demonstrated a nurturing instinct towards younger, weaker Pokémon, one individual even using its vines to pick up a crying Pokémon, gently rocking it back and forth through the air while singing a \"Bulba-by\". Its vines are long and strong enough to allow Bulbasaur to grab the branches of trees and pull itself up to reach berries. Bulbasaur can survive for days without eating. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, Bulbasaur is known to sleep in sunny spots. Bulbasaur has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Sunbathing Sleep, Sturdy Sleep, Vines-Out Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep.\n\nIt is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as first partner Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. A Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur."

    "solution": "This is ivysaur, and is a Grass/Poison-type Pokemon. Ivysaur (Japanese: フシギソウ Fushigisou) is a dual-type Grass/Poison Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt evolves from Bulbasaur starting at level 16 and evolves into Venusaur starting at level 32.\nIvysaur is a quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. On top of its head are pointed ears with black insides, and it has narrow red eyes. Ivysaur has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth and two pointed teeth in its upper jaw. Each of its feet has three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into a giant pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud.\n\nThe weight of the plant prevents Ivysaur from running fast and standing on its hind legs, forcing its legs to grow sturdy. When its flower is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. Ivysaur will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming evolution. Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both Ivysaur and its plant. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Ivysaur is known to sleep in sunny spots while undergoing its photosynthesis process. Researchers cannot decide if Ivysaur is awake or asleep during this process. Ivysaur has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Sunbathing Sleep, Sturdy Sleep, Vines-Out Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep. Ivysaur are typically found in plains."

It can Mega Evolve into Mega Venusaur using the Venusaurite, and can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Venusaur if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Gigantamax Venusaur was introduced in The Isle of Armor.\n\nVenusaur is the game mascot of Pokémon Green and its remake Pokémon LeafGreen, appearing on the box art of both games.\nVenusaur is a squat, quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon with bumpy, blue-green skin. It has small, circular red eyes and a short, blunt snout. Its mouth is wide with two pointed teeth in the upper jaw and four in the lower jaw. On top of its head are small, pointed ears with reddish-pink insides. It has three clawed toes on each foot. The bud on its back has bloomed into a large pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur has a gynoecium in the center of its flower.\n\nVenusaur uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into energy, which causes the flower to become more vibrant. The flower releases a soothing scent that attracts Pokémon and calms emotions. This scent becomes stronger after a rainy day. Venusaur is at its strongest in the summertime when there is much more sunlight to absorb. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Venusaur releases a soothing fragrance while sleeping. Venusaur has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Sunbathing Sleep, Sturdy Sleep, Vines-Out Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep. In the Pokémon the Series episode Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden, Venusaur has demonstrated the ability to manipulate nature, release several vines from its back, and lead evolution ceremonies for Bulbasaur and Ivysaur. This Pokémon is rarely found in the wild, but it has been known to inhabit grasslands."

Charmander (Japanese: ヒトカゲ Hitokage) is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt evolves into Charmeleon starting at level 16, which evolves into Charizard starting at level 36.\n\nAlong with Bulbasaur and Squirtle, Charmander is one of the three first partner Pokémon of Kanto available at the beginning of Pokémon Red, Green, Blue, FireRed, and LeafGreen.\nCharmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with a primarily orange body and blue eyes. Its underside from the chest down and the soles of its feet are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pokémon's slender tail, which has blazed there since Charmander's birth.\n\nThe flame can indicate Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander would die if its flame were to go out. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Charmander is known to sleep while curled up. Supposedly, Charmander is drawing warmth from the flame on its tail. During quiet nights, the sounds of its flame can be heard by listening carefully while Charmander sleeps. Charmander has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Crackling Sleep, Tummy-Rub Sleep, Tummy-Up Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep.\n\nCharmander can be found in hot, mountainous areas. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. However, it is found far more often in the ownership of Trainers. As shown in Pokémon Snap and New Pokémon Snap, Charmander exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if it finds food and watching the flames on each other's tails to ensure they don't go out."

It has dark red scales and a cream underside from the chest down. It has blue eyes and a long snout with a slightly hooked tip. On the back of its head is a single horn-like protrusion. It has relatively long arms with three sharp claws. Its short legs have plantigrade feet with three claws and cream-colored soles. The tip of its long, powerful tail has a flame burning on it. The temperature rises to unbearable levels if Charmeleon swings its tail.\n\nCharmeleon has a vicious, hotheaded nature and will constantly seek out opponents. Strong opponents excite this Pokémon, causing it to spout bluish-white flames that torch its surroundings. Charmeleon enjoys tormenting the opponents it fights. However, it will relax once it has won a battle. It is rare in the wild but can be found in mountainous areas. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Charmleon is known to sleep with a laid-back posture, using its hands as a pillow. Its fierce fervor disappears when it sleeps. Charmeleon has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Arm-Pillow Sleep, Seated Sleep, Loafing Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep."

    "problem": "What is in the images?",
    "solution": "This is charizard, and is a Fire/Flying/Dragon-type Pokemon. Charizard (Japanese: リザードン Lizardon) is a dual-type Fire/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt evolves from Charmeleon starting at level 36. It is the final form of Charmander.\n\nCharizard has three forms: Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Gigantamax Charizard. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X using the Charizardite X and Mega Charizard Y using the Charizardite Y, and can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Charizard if it has the Gigantamax Factor.\n\nCharizard is the game mascot of Pokémon Red and its remake Pokémon FireRed, appearing on the boxart of both games.\n\nAlong with Pikachu, Talonflame, and Decidueye, Charizard is one of the four partner Pokémon available through the Unite Licenses in Pokémon UNITE as of version 1.12.1.2.\nCharizard is a draconic, bipedal Pokémon. It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. Two fangs are visible in its upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. In Pokémon Red and Green, Charizard is seemingly shown holding a fireball, implying that it's capable of manipulating its flames using its hands; this is seen in media where it uses Fire Punch. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame, which can intensify to a blue flame if Charizard is irritated.\n\nCharizard typically inhabits mountains and valleys, such as the Charicific Valley in Johto. However, Charizard can also live in volcanoes, forming packs with other members of its family, including Charmander. In Pokémon Snap, it's shown that Charizard are fully capable of living inside lava within volcanic craters.\n\nCharizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath can melt boulders and massive glaciers and has been known to cause forest fires accidentally. Though its fiery breath is hot, it never turns it on any opponent weaker than itself. The Pokémon the Series episode Charizard's Burning Ambitions showed that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. The side story episode Those Darn Electabuzz! showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pokémon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. Charizard's wings can carry it to an altitude of 4,600 feet (1,400 meters), but An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS notes that its droppings were found on Mt. Fuji, implying it could fly thrice as high. In Pokémon Sleep, as well as media like the animated series, Charizard is known to sleep in an incredibly relaxed position, as it is very confident in its power. Some Charizard are occasionally seen sleeping flat on their backs, which is potentially a sign that those Charizard are especially strong. Charizard has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Stomach Sleep, Tummy-Rub Sleep, Tummy-Up Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep. Charizard are apparently vulnerable to their tail flame going out in the same way as Charmander as evidenced by the Pokémon the Series: The Beginning episode Charizard Chills where Ash warns his Charizard to not let its flame go out.\n\nEven though Charizard originally couldn't learn the move Fly, Trainers have been shown riding Charizard in official artwork dating back to the 1997 Carddass Trading Cards. Ash himself was shown riding his Charizard already in the second season of the original series of Pokémon the Series. Eventually, in Pokémon Yellow, Charizard became able to learn Fly and has since been frequently depicted as a Pokémon able to carry people on its back to fly them to distant areas. In Alola, Charizard is a Ride Pokémon called Charizard Glide, being used by the natives to fly around the region or make deliveries."

Squirtle (Japanese: ゼニガメ Zenigame) is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt evolves into Wartortle starting at level 16, which evolves into Blastoise starting at level 36.\n\nAlong with Bulbasaur and Charmander, Squirtle is one of the three first partner Pokémon of Kanto available at the beginning of Pokémon Red, Green, Blue, FireRed, and LeafGreen.\nSquirtle is a small reptilian Pokémon that resembles a light-blue turtle. While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It has large, purplish, or reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet has three pointed digits. The end of its long, squirrel-like tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves.\n\nSquirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for protection or to sleep. The grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance, allowing the Pokémon to swim at high speeds. Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes. Squirtle can also be found residing around rivers in mountainous regions, as shown in Pokémon Snap and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. In the Pokémon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise, Squirtle is shown to be found living on secluded islands with other members of their evolutionary line. Sharpedo is a natural predator of Squirtle. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Squirtle is known to sleep by withdrawing its limbs and head into its shell. It does this to protect itself from threats while sleeping. It also occasionally rocks contentedly from side to side while sleeping. Squirtle has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Sheltered Sleep, Unsheltered Sleep, Overturned Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep.\n\nIn Generation II, Squirtle and its evolved forms were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."

Wartortle (Japanese: カメール Kameil) is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt evolves from Squirtle starting at level 16 and evolves into Blastoise starting at level 36.\nWartortle is a bipedal, indigo reptilian Pokémon similar to a turtle. It has brown eyes, a dark blue streak on each cheek, and two sharp teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers and pointed toes. On each side of its head are feather-like ears covered in pale blue fur. A brown shell with a pale yellow underside encases its body. A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older Wartortle may have scars and algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of the shell is a thick, wavy tail that also has light blue fur and cannot be fully withdrawn into its shell. Its tail fur will darken with age. Its tail symbolizes longevity and good luck, making this Pokémon popular with the elderly.\n\nBecause it is larger than Squirtle and has a larger shell, Wartortle has a more difficult time walking on land and keeping its balance in the water. Wartortle moves its furry ears and tail as both rudders and balancing rods to maintain balance while swimming at high speeds. Air can be stored in its fur for extended underwater diving. It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey. It's shown in the Pokémon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise that Wartortle can be found living in colonies on islands. Still, its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, is known to sleep with its body tucked into its shell while remaining wary of threats. It leaves its long, furry tail poking out a bit to feel out its surroundings in case of danger. Wartortle has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Sheltered Sleep, Unsheltered Sleep, Flattened Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep.\n\nIn Generation II, Wartortle and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."

It can Mega Evolve into Mega Blastoise using the Blastoisinite, and can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Blastoise if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Gigantamax Blastoise was introduced in The Isle of Armor.\n\nBlastoise is the game mascot of the Japanese and international versions of Pokémon Blue, appearing on the boxart of both games.\nBlastoise is a large, bipedal turtle Pokémon. Its body is blue and is mostly hidden by its tough, brown shell. This shell has a cream-colored underside and a white ridge encircling its arms and separating the upper and lower halves. Two powerful water cannons/jet nozzles reside at the top of its shell over its shoulders. These cannons can be extended or withdrawn. Blastoise's head has triangular ears that are black on the inside, small brown eyes, and a cream-colored lower jaw. Its arms are thick, and it has three claws on each hand. Its feet have three claws on the front and one on the back. Poking out of the bottom of its shell is a stubby tail.\n\nThe powerful cannons on this Pokémon's back can produce water blasts that can pierce steel and concrete and be used for high-speed charges. The speed of Blastoise's charges is similar to the force of a rocket. Blastoise makes itself heavy to withstand these powerful blasts and crush its opponents. It is shown in the Pokémon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise that Blastoise can take the role of a leader in large groups of Squirtle and Wartortle. Its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. Blastoise is capable of flying by propelling itself with water from the back openings of its shell. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Blastoise is known to sleep soundly while protected by its tough shell. Blastoise has also been seen sleeping with its belly exposed on very rare occasions. This is due to Blastoise feeling completely secure in its surroundings and quickly falling asleep. Blastoise has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Sheltered Sleep, Unsheltered Sleep, Overturned Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep.\n\nIn Generation II, Blastoise and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."

Caterpie (Japanese: キャタピー Caterpie) is a Bug-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt evolves into Metapod starting at level 7, which evolves into Butterfree starting at level 10.\nCaterpie is an insect Pokémon that resembles a green caterpillar with a yellow underside and teardrop-shaped tail. Yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its segmented body resemble its eyes and are meant to scare off predators. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna (osmeterium) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. Despite these features and its camouflage in green foliage, Caterpie is often preyed upon by Flying-type Pokémon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pokémon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort.\n\nCaterpie is easy to capture and grows quickly, making it ideal for new Trainers. As Caterpie grow and develop over time, they will shed their skin many times before finally cocooning themselves in thick silk. It can also spit this silk to entangle foes as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Ash Catches a Pokémon. It has a voracious appetite, driving it to eat a hundred leaves daily. It will even eat leaves bigger than itself. According to the 54th chapter of Pokémon Adventures, its favorite food is the Vermilion flower. Caterpie lives in temperate forests and jungles. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Caterpie is known to sleep occasionally while using String Shot. On occasion, it drools out strings instead of saliva."

Its body is crescent-shaped, with several segments making up the lower point. It has two heavy-lidded eyes on the sides of its shell, while the front of its shell feature geometrically shaped portions and projections, and the back has three pointed protrusions; two veering towards the sides, and one in the middle. In certain angles, the back of a Metapod's shell resembles a face alongside the eyes on the sides, with one of the protrusions resembling a sharply pointed nose, and the tail resembling a sharply pointed chin.\n\nMetapod's soft body is protected by a hard outer shell as it undergoes metamorphosis. While this shell is said to be as hard as steel, a sudden, powerful impact could cause its liquid innards to pop out, leaving it completely exposed. Metapod generally remains motionless, rebuilding its cells for Evolution. If an enemy discovers Metapod, it cannot do anything other than harden its outer shell. Metapod lives in temperate forests and jungles, often in groups. Pikipek is a natural predator of Metapod. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Metapod is known to sleep while using the move Harden constantly to protect its innards. It stays still while sleeping to avoid getting attacked by foes."

Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree's lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.\n\nThe wings of Butterfree are coated with poisonous scales that easily fall off continuously as it flies. If inhaled, it results in several status conditions. Using this powder, it will defend Caterpie from bird Pokémon. This powder also repels water, enabling it to fly and gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree can use its sensitive antenna to detect the odors of blooming flowers six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of nectar, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes, it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode A Sappy Ending. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it also observed in the episode Bye Bye Butterfree flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Butterfree is known to sleep while flapping its wings. It tends to accidentally scatter highly toxic dust while sleeping."

Pidgey is common throughout its range and can often be seen in meadows and temperate forests. Ekans and Sneasel are natural predators of Pidgey.\n\nIn Generation III, Feather Dance was its signature move, though other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."

It has narrow eyes containing white sclera and pupil with red irises, rounded ears with cream-colored insides, and a single whisker on each cheek. Its long tail is tightly curled at the end. Its most notable feature is its large teeth. Like most rodents, its teeth grow continuously throughout its life and must be worn down by gnawing. This also ensures that Rattata is not awoken by the sound of its grinding teeth while sleeping. Females will have shorter whiskers.\n\nRattata can live wherever it can find food, which it searches for most of the day. Thanks to its sharp fangs, it is able to chew on nearly anything. When it is threatened, Rattata can deliver a powerful bite. Rattata constantly keep their ears up and will immediately scurry away from the slightest sound. Furret is the natural predator of Rattata. Its hardiness lets it live in many environments, although it mainly lives on plains and savannas. Because it reproduces so quickly, a pair of Rattata can quickly colonize an area.

Its jaw can detach to swallow large prey, but such a meal can make Ekans too heavy to move or become stuck and cause them to faint. It wraps itself around tree branches at night to rest. If not in a tree, it will coil itself up—a position in which it can defend itself from all directions. In the second movie, it is revealed to possess some swimming abilities. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Ekans are known to sleep with their bodies all coiled up.

It has narrow eyes and several sharp teeth. Just below its head is a large hood with a face-like pattern. This pattern has over 20 possible variations. The pattern typically has two red and yellow eyespots outlined in black, a wide black streak resembling an upturned mouth, and a black V-shaped stripe above the eyespots.\n\nArbok is capable of crushing opponents by coiling its body around them and squeezing them tightly. It can even flatten steel oil drums. If it encounters an enemy, it raises its head, mimics, and stuns the opponent using the frightening pattern on its body. It can also make eerie sounds by expelling air from its mouth. It has been stated that if any part of Arbok's body except for the head is cut off, it can regrow the rest of its body again in a few weeks. It also can detect vibrations as shown in the Pokémon the Series episode The Whistle Stop.

Ordinary Pikachu can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Pikachu if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Additionally, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media.\n\nCosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Pikachu with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve. The Pikachu received at the beginning of Pokémon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file.\n\nPikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and one of Nintendo's major mascots. It is also the game mascot of and the player's first Pokémon in Pokémon Yellow and Let's Go, Pikachu!, the player's first Pokémon in Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World, and has made numerous appearances on the covers of spin-off games.\nPikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs; therefore, Pikachu is a facultative biped.\n\nIn the Pokémon the Series episode Pikachu's Goodbye, wild Pikachu are shown to live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In A Plethora of Pikachu!, it is shown that Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as with other Electric-type Pokémon. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. In The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, it is depicted eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant. While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter.\n\nPikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It can release electric discharges of varying intensity. In the Pokémon the Series episode Sparks Fly for Magnemite, Pikachu is shown to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharge fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu and its evolutionary relatives are related to Pachirisu. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Pikachu is known to generate electricity through its cheeks while sleeping. Pikachu discharges while sleeping due to it dreaming of firing electric shots.\n\nPikachu and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle.

There is a circular yellow marking on each cheek where its electric sacs are, and it has a triangular, dark brown nose. Its arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, and the soles of its long feet are tan with a circular orange pad in the center. On its back are two horizontal brown stripes. Its long, thin tail has a lightning bolt-shaped end. This lightning bolt is chipped on females. Raichu exudes a weak electrical charge from its body and glows slightly in the dark.\n\nRaichu's tail is used to gather electricity from the atmosphere, or it can be planted in the ground to search for electricity. It also protects Raichu from its high-voltage power. Raichu can store over 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out a Copperajah. If Raichu's sacs are fully charged, its ears will stand straight up, and its muscles will become stimulated. However, it will become aggressive if it has stored too much electricity and stress. To prevent it from reaching this state, it discharges electricity through its tail into the ground. This leads to scorched patches near its nest. Being the result of evolution via Evolution stone, Raichu is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and woodlands. The main reason Raichu is rarely seen with Pokémon trainers is because people prefer the look it had as Pikachu. As revealed in the Pokémon the Series episode Electric Shock Showdown, Raichu is not capable of learning speed attacks upon evolving and can only learn them when they're still Pikachu. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Raichu is known to sleep while discharging electricity, and a long tail is planted into the ground like a rod. It can electrocute anyone who comes near it while sleeping.\n\nRaichu and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle."

While its body can efficiently absorb water to facilitate life in the desert, Sandshrew has been found in caves as well. It also lives deep underground in nests it has created from digging tunnels. Should hard rocks get in the way of digging, Sandshrew will use its sharp claws to remove them before continuing to dig. If it is too wet, its skin becomes wrinkly. It dries itself out by using the geothermal heat near a volcano. It is also known to bathe in sand, which helps remove dirt and moisture from its body."

It has several darker purple patches across its body. It has large, spiny ears with teal insides, narrow black eyes, and a long snout with two pointed teeth protruding from the upper jaw. Nidorino has a ridge of toxic spines on its back and a long, pointed horn on its forehead. The horn is harder than a diamond and can secrete poison on impact. The more adrenaline Nidorino has in its body, the more potent the poison is. Its short legs have three claws on each foot. Nidorino is a male-only species.\n\nNidorino is independent, nervous, and fierce, often described as violent and easily angered. It uses its ears to check its surroundings. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might. Nidorino's harder-than-diamond horn can destroy diamonds, and it uses that horn to destroy boulders in its search for Moon Stones. Nidorino live in hot savannas and plains."

Gray plates cover its chest and belly, with a gray, rounded spine on each elbow. Each hand has three claws, while each foot has only a single hoof-like nail. It has a long, powerful tail. Nidoking is a male-only species.\n\nIt is said that Nidoking's tail can topple a metal transmission tower. Nidoking uses this tail to smash, constrict, or break the bones of its prey and enemies. The tail can also be swung to create distance between it and its foes before Nidoking charges. Its steel-like hide adds to its powerful, rampaging charges. Nidoking's horn is powerful enough to crush diamonds. Nidoking is known to be very proud of its own strength. When Nidoking goes on a rampage, it becomes impossible to control. Only a Nidoqueen that it has lived with for a long time can calm it down from its rampages. As shown in the 21st chapter of Pokémon Adventures, Nidoking has strong acid within its claws. Being the result of evolution via an Evolution stone, Nidoking is rarely found in the wild. However, they can be found in savannas and plains."

There is a pair of tiny, butterfly-shaped wings on its back. Though incapable of flight, Clefairy's wings can store moonlight and allow it to float.\n\nClefairy is very shy and rarely shows itself to humans. On the rare occasions that Clefairy comes down from its mountain home, it can be seen dancing underneath the full moon's light. The area surrounding their dance is enveloped in a magnetic field. Once the sun rises, it returns home, where it sleeps nestled with other Clefairy. There have been many sightings of Clefairy during the morning aftermath of the full moon. In the Pokémon the Series episode Clefairy Tales, Clefairy is depicted as an extraterrestrial Pokémon. Clefairy is known to be popular thanks to both its adorable look and behavior. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, anyone who sees a Clefairy using Metronome while sleeping will receive happiness.

It can float by drawing extra air into its body, as demonstrated in Super Smash Bros.\n\nJigglypuff can use its eyes to mesmerize opponents. It has a large lung capacity, exceeding most other Pokémon. Once it has an opponent's attention, Jigglypuff will inflate its lungs and sing a soothing and mysterious lullaby. This melody can cause anyone who listens to become sleepy. If the opponent resists falling asleep, Jigglypuff will endanger its life by continuing to sing until it runs out of air. It will continue to sing until the opponent is asleep. It can adjust the wavelength of its voice to match the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep. This helps ensure drowsiness in its opponents. Its vocal range exceeds 12 octaves, but its skill depends on the individual. Its song varies by region, and it sounds like shouting in some areas. Jigglypuff is mostly found in lush green plains and grassy meadows. Scream Tail shares a resemblance to Jigglypuff. It is believed Scream Tail is Jigglypuff's ancestor from 1,000,000,000 years ago.

The frequency of these cries can vary slightly between Zubat colonies. As demonstrated in the Pokémon the Series episode Clefairy and the Moon Stone, it will leave its abode at night with a mass of other Zubat to seek prey. Zubat is nocturnal and sleeps hanging upside down during the daytime, avoiding sunlight at all costs. Daylight causes Zubat to become unhealthy; prolonged exposure can even burn its skin.

Despite this, Golbat can walk skillfully on the ground.\n\nGolbat's fangs have hollow tubes (similar to straws) specialized for sucking blood. While they are strong enough to pierce thick hide, they are also unexpectedly fragile. There are some Golbat that have missing fangs as a result of their hunger-fueled attempt to try drinking blood from Steel-type Pokémon. Golbat feeds on the blood of both Pokémon and humans and is capable of drinking over 10 ounces (300 milliliters) of blood in one sitting. It is gluttonous, and drinks so much blood that its blood type will change to that of its victim following a feed. It occasionally gorges itself to the extent that it becomes too heavy to fly, leaving itself vulnerable in turn. However, it is also willing to share gathered blood with other members of its kind that are hungry. One particular Golbat could utilize Supersonic to produce a magic mirror in its mouth for scrying to see things from a distance, even if walls or land are in the way.

Each head is incredibly tough with a smooth surface, and has brown skin, black eyes, and a large, round, pink nose. Dugtrio's three heads think the same thoughts and act cooperatively, though on rare occasions may fight over which head gets to eat first. In order to make burrowing easier, each head will bob up and down to loosen the soil. Dugtrio can tunnel under the earth at 60 mph (100 km/h) to a depth of 60 miles (100 kilometers), triggering tremors and earthquakes. It is capable of burrowing endlessly. Dugtrio lives in tunnels and caves under the earth. Dugtrio is considered important for agriculture as its digging aerates the soil and makes it suitable for farming. As shown in the Pikachu short Pikachu's Rescue Adventure, Dugtrio sometimes lives in hollow trees in forests. It maintains the soil and plants trees to revitalize wooded areas. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, the three triplets of Dugtrio is known to sleep together, never separating from each other. The trio's teamwork remains strong even when sleeping.\n\nIn Generation II, Dugtrio and its pre-evolved form, Diglett, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Fissure."

Its ovoid head features four prominent whiskers, wide eyes with slit pupils, two pointed teeth in the upper jaw, and a gold koban coin embedded in its forehead. Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs. While the games almost always depict Meowth on two legs, it is stated in the Pokémon the Series episode Go West Young Meowth that Meowth normally walks on all fours.\n\nMeowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using its signature move, Pay Day. Meowth and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Pay Day by leveling up.

Its thick whiskers are very sensitive to changes in air movements, enabling it to detect its prey by movement alone. In the center of its forehead is a red jewel. Its long tail has a distinctive curl at the end. Persian communicates with body language and holds its tail upright to signal its intention to pounce. It has long legs and three-toed paws with retractable claws. Persian's lithe muscles also enable it to walk without making a sound.\n\nPersian normally lives in towns and cities. Although popular for its elegance, it is extremely difficult to raise as a pet due to its fickle and temperamental personality. It will scratch anyone, including its Trainer, with little or no provocation, and has been observed ripping its prey apart for no discernible reason. However, when Persian is yanked by its whiskers, it becomes temporarily docile for unknown reasons. It is popular among rich people and is targeted by hunters for its jewel. Its relationship with Perrserker is one of mutual disdain, as Persian's refined and elegant personality clashes with Perrserker's barbaric nature. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Persian is known to clean and groom itself even when asleep. Even when asleep, Persian maintains its striking and haughty expression.\n\nPersian and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Pay Day by leveling up."

Its legs and tail are stubby, and it has cream-colored webbed feet. There are three claws on each of its hands.\n\nPsyduck is constantly stunned by its headache and is unable to think very clearly. It usually stands immobile, trying to calm its headache. However, when its headache becomes too severe, Psyduck releases tension in the form of strong psychic powers. The use of these powers produces brain waves identical to those seen in sleepers, and the Pokémon is unable to recall these episodes. Psyduck lives in freshwater lakes and small ponds, but can be seen in rivers in tropical areas as shown in Pokémon Snap. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Psyduck suffers headaches while it sleeps.

Its hands and feet all have three clawed digits with cream-colored webbing in between. Its body is specially adapted to have a hydrodynamic shape, and it has a long tail that it uses as a rudder to steer. Golduck is sometimes mistaken for the Japanese monster, and the physical inspiration for Golduck, the Kappa due to its general humanoid shape, beak, and webbed hands and feet.\n\nGolduck is a fast swimmer, capable of out-swimming even the most athletic of humans because of its webbed appendages. Even rough seas do not hamper this Pokémon's swimming abilities, and it will sometimes rescue people from shipwrecks. The TCG depicts Golduck with the ability to shoot massive jets of water form both of its hands simultaneously, using them to propel itself underwater. The gem on its forehead glows when it uses its psychic powers, and occasionally when it swims at full speed. In the past, this Pokémon was overhunted due to the belief that the gem granted people supernatural powers. As seen in Pokémon Adventures, Golduck has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pokémon through telepathy. Golduck can typically be seen swimming in lakes, where it hunts fish. The prey is disabled, captured, and then brought to shore for consumption. Old tales claim Golduck punishes those who defile their rivers by dragging them in and taking them away.

Mankey's three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown.\n\nMankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, it begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated.\n\nAccording to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts. However, Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell. Additionally, it also appears to be fond of bananas, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Showdown at the Po-ké Corral. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, it is rare to find a Mankey sleeping without an angry look on its face."

There is usually a throbbing vein on the left side of its forehead, and it has triangular ears with pink insides, narrow eyes with tiny pupils, and a pink, snout-like nose. Its arms and legs are brown and have metal shackles on the wrists and ankles. This is probably indicative of a method of training with weights. The hands have no visible fingers, instead resembling mittens or boxing gloves, and the feet have two toes.\n\nPrimeape is easily angered; even the slightest glance of eye contact will make it furious. When it becomes enraged, its blood circulation is boosted. This makes its muscles stronger, but at the cost of some of its intelligence. Primeape also possesses the ability to convert its anger into energy to attack its opponents with. It has sturdy vessels in its brain that keep it healthy despite its constant anger. It will chase anyone who upsets it and will not stop until it has caught up to its target. Even if it is awoken from sleep, it will groggily chase whatever woke it. Some researchers have a theory Primeape is angry even when inside a Poké Ball. In some cases, Primeape has been known to die as a result of its rage, though it is also said to look peaceful in death, potentially due to its rage transcending and leaving its physical form to become something new. In the Pokémon the Series episode Showdown at the Po-ké Corral, it is shown to have a fondness for bananas. Primeape can be found on mountains. It competes with Ursaring when it comes to searching for berries. In Paldea, Hawlucha is Primeape's natural enemy.

It has large eyes and pink lips that can also act as suction cups for rocks. Its skin is very thin, but flexible and difficult to puncture. There is a black and white swirl on its abdomen, which is actually its internal organs showing through its semitransparent skin. The swirl is clearer following a meal and will have a white tinge if the Pokémon is affected by disease. The direction of the belly spiral differs by area; the equator is thought to have an effect on it.\n\nPoliwag has newly developed legs that are poor at walking and no arms. It has a long, thin tail surrounded by a light-blue, semitransparent fin. Its tail makes it a powerful swimmer. It loves to waddle on land despite the dangers.

All of its skin feels this way except where its swirl is, which is instead very smooth. The swirl on its belly undulates slowly and staring at it induces drowsiness.\n\nEven though Poliwhirl is capable of moving on land, it prefers to stay in freshwater ponds and lakes where it has fewer natural enemies. It feeds on both bug and fish Pokémon. While it will leave the water to capture bug Pokémon, it will return and consume them underwater in safety. Its swirl is used to make children fall asleep.

Machoke is a popular Pokémon used as a motif for sculptures. In spite of this, it is modest and often helps people with manual labor. The belt it wears regulates its strength, but Machoke removes it when facing a truly powerful opponent. It can be found in the mountains, where it trains daily. In Generation II, Vital Throw was its signature move."

It has bluish-gray skin, red eyes, and large, pale, yellow lips. On its head, there are three brown ridges right above its eyes. It has two arms on each side of its body: a pair located in the normal position, and another pair directly above that attaches on the top of the shoulders. It has black markings that resemble briefs and wears a golden power-save belt that resembles a championship belt. Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes each.\n\nMachamp are said to know every martial arts style in the world. It punches extremely quickly, throwing 500 punches a second. With only one hand, it can move a mountain. In Generation VII, Strength was its signature move. Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe's limbs down at once. Its arms also allow it to attack and defend simultaneously. The four arms react much faster than Machamp can think. However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled. The belt it wears restricts its muscle activity, but it can cause consequences if removed. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Machamp is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in the mountains. In Alola, Machamp is used as a Ride Pokémon called Machamp Shove, where Marchamp carries humans on its arms while moving large rocks out fo the way.\n\nIn Generation II, Vital Throw was its signature move."

Long-lived Geodude are completely smooth and round and they have a calm demeanor. However, Geodude's heart remains rugged and tough, no matter what. Geodude can be most often found on mountain trails and fields, with a scholar counting about 100 of them on just one route. It will sit still in these areas, which is why it is often mistaken for a rock. It is often stepped on and will sometimes swing its arms in anger when this occurs. When Geodude sleeps deeply, it buries itself halfway into the ground. Once buried, it will not awaken even if someone steps on it. In the morning, Geodude rolls downhill in search of food."

It often rolls down mountain paths at high speeds exceeding 60 mph, crushing objects in the way and stopping by running into huge rocks should it build up too much speed. However, it will explode if it rolls into a river instead. Graveler is known to be generally free and uncaring, not minding if pieces of itself break off, as it can restore itself over time. Graveler climbs a mountain from base to summit, feasting on rocks all the while. Graveler's favorite rock to eat is moss-covered rocks. It regularly consumes tons of moss-covered rocks and makes loud noises while eating. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls down to the bottom. Graveler live in horizontal holes that they gouge out in sheer cliff faces, and they are capable of withstanding volcanic temperatures. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Graveler is known to rock back and forth while sleeping. It is believed that Graveler is dreaming about rolling down hilly paths."

As shown in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards, Golem's shell is hollow, despite it looking like it is not.\n\nAs shown in The Bridge Bike Gang, Golem can withdraw its head and limbs into its shell and roll at high speeds. It is dangerous when doing this, as it is unable to see and may crash into or run over anything in its path. To prevent it from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves are dug into the sides of the mountains to divert the rolling Golem's course. It is seldom seen in the wild. However, it can be found living in mountainous regions. Golem are known to detonate their own body. It uses this explosive force to jump from mountain to mountain. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Golem is known to occasionally sleep upside down. It is believed that Golem rocks itself into a deep slumber, similar to a cradle. However, there's a chance a sleeping Golem may roll into anyone nearby it, hence why it is best to stay clear of Golem while it sleeps."

This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. Slowpoke tails are considered a delicacy and commonly used as a cooking ingredient: in Alola, they are often dried and used in home-cooked stews, while in Galar, they are smoked and packaged as a curry ingredient. Slowpoke is also known to dive underwater to hunt, but is often itself caught instead.\n\nSlowpoke has a notoriously dim intellect and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water's edge. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke's yawn causes rain. This Pokémon is worshiped in those areas. Its vacant expression is said to help some people relax, whilst causing irritation to others. It is posited that those who lead hectic lives are most likely to become relaxed.

Prior to Generation II, it was a pure Electric-type Pokémon.\n\nIt evolves into Magneton starting at level 30, which evolves into Magnezone when leveled up in a special magnetic field or when exposed to a Thunder Stone.\n\n(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to Game data→Evolution data for these details.)\nMagnemite is a seemingly robotic Pokémon that has a gray, spherical metal body, with blue-and-red tipped horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye. It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokédex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, it is shown in the Pokémon the Series episode Get Along, Little Pokémon that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. In The Poké Spokesman, it exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrition are electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph. It has also been present in AZ's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years.\n\nThe magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode The Poké Spokesman, it's shown that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. Should it run out of electricity, Magnemite will fall to the ground. Usually, batteries can help recharge it in order for Magnemite to start moving again.\n\nMagnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Pokétch. In the episode Sparks Fly for Magnemite, it is shown to be attracted to electric Pokémon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Magnemite is known to sleep airbone by generating electromagnetic waves from its side magnets.There are rare occasions where while Magnemite sleeps and muddles to the direction of its waves, it will loop in the air while sleeping."

Refer to Game data→Evolution data for these details.)\n\nThe Paradox Pokémon Sandy Shocks is said to be an ancient relative of Magneton or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline.\nMagneton is a robot-like Pokémon, the result of three Magnemite becoming linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when there are no other Magnemite in the vicinity. Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Pokémon Snap, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6 °F (2 °C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (one kilometer). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area.\n\nMagneton's anti-gravitational powers enable it to fly through the air. Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still needs to eat. As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode The Poké Spokesman, food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain, often near power plants.\n\nWhen sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen in the eleventh chapter of Pokémon Adventures, it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. As seen in the Pokémon Horizons: The Series episode The Future I Choose, it can cause interference with phone and internet signals. In An Unexpected Picnic!, a herd of Magneton produced an EMP that could destroy computer software. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph. One was shown in the Pokémon Generations episode The Redemption in a flashback to the great war of Kalos, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. Additionally, Sandy Shocks bears a strong resemblance to Magneton. It is believed to be an ancient Magneton that was alive 10,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Magneton is known to sleep with its three linked Magnemite either stuck together or drifting apart by a strong magnetic force. It is theoried that its magnetism is unstable while Magneton sleeps."

It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead (similar to a unibrow), and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.\n\nFarfetch'd is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch'd will defend it with its life. Losing the stalk can leave Farfetch'd defenseless, and it will seek out a new one to replace it. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. When using the stalk to attack, Farfetch'd wields and uses it like a sword to cut through things. There are several different fighting styles involving Farfetch'd's leek. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. Farfetch'd is found in temperate grasslands where reedy plants grow, guarding the plants from anyone trying to disturb them. However, Farfetch'd is rarely seen, and thus it is thought that its numbers are decreasing, and that it is at risk of extinction. According to sources such as Pokémon the Series and the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, its population decline is caused by humans who hunted it down for food; one popular recipe suggested cooking it with its own leek. There have been attempts at breeding in order to increase the Farfetch'd population. In the Pikachu short Pikachu's Vacation, Farfetch'd are shown to be able to swim like real-life ducks.\n\nFarfetch'd and Sirfetch'd are the only known Pokémon capable of using the Leek item."

    "solution": "This is doduo, and is a Normal/Flying-type Pokemon. Doduo (Japanese: ドードー Dodo) is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt evolves into Dodrio starting at level 31.\nDoduo is a two-headed, bipedal avian Pokémon. Each head has a long sharp beak and two beady black eyes. It has a bristly, down-like covering of brown feathers on its body and both heads. A male has black flexible necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs. Each foot has four digits ending in a sharp claw. Both heads have an identical brain. However, it is believed that on occasion they may possess different brains. It is also theorized that the two heads communicate with some form of telepathy for coordination. Even when sleeping or nourishing itself with food and water, one head is usually awake and alert and keeps a keen eye out for enemies. The two heads switch turns every hour or so, with both only sleeping at the same time when they feel completely safe. Both heads have the same genes and battle together in perfect sync.\n\nDue to its almost non-existent wings, it cannot fly very well. However, it has developed legs that make it a powerful runner. Reaching speeds of 60 mph (100 km/h), it energetically strides across the plains leaving large 4-inch (10-centimeter) deep footprints behind it. It can better maintain balance while running by raising and lowering its two heads. Doduo lives in wide open plains, grasslands, and savannahs."

    "solution": "This is dodrio, and is a Normal/Flying-type Pokemon. Dodrio (Japanese: ドードリオ Dodorio) is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt evolves from Doduo starting at level 31.\nDodrio is a large, wingless, three-headed avian Pokémon. Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black V-shaped, feather crest. It has bristly brown feathers covering its head and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its tail consists of three pale red feathers with lighter tips. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs.\n\nEach head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion, it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. The strongest of Dodrio's heads and the thickest neck will become the leader and gain primary control of the body. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking.\n\nAlong with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains, even in arid seasons with little rainfall. As a result, despite being slower than Doduo, Dodrio can keep running for an even longer time. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dodrio is known to usually sleep standing up. Each of the three heads taking turns sleeping while one head stays awake. However, should Dodrio become very tired, even the head that remains awake may start to doze off."

It has a pale tan canine maw with a large red tongue and a pair of tusks on its lower jaw. It has circular eyes, prominent black eyebrows (it’s one of the few Pokémon that has eyebrows) and a black nose that is capable of closing when it swims. There is a small horn on its forehead, which it uses in combination with its tusks to bore through ice floes. It has two flippers on its chest, and two more on the end of its tail.

It thrives in these cold environments, becoming more active as the temperature drops and tires easily in warm waters. Preferring to sleep during the day, it hunts for prey under sheets of ice in the late day and evening hours. While it is a graceful swimmer, it is awkward and struggles to move on dry land."

On top of its head is a sharp horn, which allows it to cut through the thickest ice floes.\n\nIt lives on icebergs adrift in frigid ocean waters. It thrives in lower temperatures, becoming increasingly more active the colder the weather. By storing thermal energy within its body, it is completely unharmed by even the most intense freezing weather. During daylight hours, it sleeps on bitterly cold ice or under shallow water. However, at night when the temperature drops, it becomes a hunter and searches for prey such as Wishiwashi. Following a meal, it sunbathes on the beach.

It evolves into Alolan Muk starting at level 38. These Grimer can also be found in Blueberry Academy's Terarium.\nGrimer is a slimy, amorphous Pokémon, born from sludge in dirty streams or seabeds that are exposed to lunar radiation. It has two large eyes with beady pupils and a gaping mouth with a gray tongue. While it lacks any visible legs, it does have two arms with three digits on each hand. Its purple sludge body contains a variety of pungent bacteria, which are so potent that it renders soil barren and incapable of supporting plant life. It is constantly oozing a bacteria-rich fluid from all parts of its body. Should it run out of internal germs, Grimer will die. Pieces of it often break off during travel and go on to become new Grimer. When combined with another Grimer, it produces new poisonous compounds.\n\nDue to its lack of a solid form, Grimer is capable of squeezing into any space or crevices with relative ease. It uses this to penetrate sewage pipes and feed off of the filthy wastewater inside. Its population fluctuates based on the availability of waste, which is Grimer's main diet. It can be found in polluted lakes and streams, as well as within cities and factories where trash and industrial waste can be found. In recent years, thanks to efforts in environmental improvements and a decrease in their food source of waste, Grimer is now facing extinction.\n\nPrior to Generation IV, Grimer and its evolved form, Muk, were the only known Pokémon that could have Stench as an Ability."

However, it typically keeps one hand tucked in while it extends the other hand.\n\nMuk is a living biohazard, leaking toxins that instantly kill all plant life it touches. Even it being in close proximity to plants will cause them to wilt and die. Extreme caution is advised in avoiding any contact with this Pokémon, as an accidental brush-up can lead to severe sickness. The effects of this Pokémon can leave the landscape barren for three years. It will readily consume nearly any waste or refuse generated by people and Pokémon alike.

    "problem": "What is in the images?",
    "solution": "This is shellder, and is a Water-type Pokemon. Shellder (Japanese: シェルダー Shellder) is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt evolves into Cloyster when exposed to a Water Stone.\nShellder is a bivalve mollusk Pokémon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. Its long, red tongue, usually hidden due to the darkness of Shellder’s body, extends from its often closed mouth. Shellder uses this tongue to burrow into the sand to sleep overnight and to lure and capture prey. If it were to close its shell, nothing could come to it; however, the tongue protrudes even when its shell is shut. Tugging on it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way.\n\nShellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pokémon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock, the two will instead evolve into Slowking. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In Galar, Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths, causing the evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively.\n\nRegardless of which form the two Pokémon evolve into, Shellder's shell transforms into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder will have a red jewel on its underside and a large horn on either side of its shell.\n\nWhile in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokémon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body. As seen in Slowking's Crowning! and An Evolution in Taste!, the crown form of Shellder can take control of humans who wear it and speak through its host. The control of Shellder wears off the moment the crown is removed.\n\nDespite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Despite its appearance, Shellder is surprisingly fast. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar, whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell. Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, are related to Shellos and Gastrodon. Kingler, Rufflet, and Bruxish are modern predators of Shellder.\n\nPrior to Generation III, Clamp was its signature move. Prior to Generation V, Icicle Spear was also its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding. Additionally, prior to Generation V, Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, were the only known Pokémon that could have Skill Link as an Ability."

It is encased inside a light-gray shell, which is surrounded by a second jagged, blue-violet outer shell casing. It has one barb-like spike protruding from above its head, and multiple conical horns on its outer shell. Its shell is harder than a diamond with spikes that are even harder; harsh tidal currents will affect the size and sharpness of these spikes. On its pearl-like face, it has two white eyes and a mouth. Aside from its face and head, its internal anatomy has never been seen. Once it has shut itself in, it is impossible to open its shell from the outside. This impressive defense allows it to withstand anything from a bomb blast to even a missile strike.\n\nCloyster typically only opens its shell to attack an opponent. However, it is fully capable of retaliating against any enemy with its shell tightly closed. With rapid succession, it launches its spikes at the foe, keeping them repelled. The same projectile system it uses to launch its spikes is also used for swimming. It swallows seawater and then ejects it towards the rear, pushing it through with siphon-jet propulsion. Being the result of Shellder evolving through an Evolution stone, Cloyster is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found on the sea floor, nestled among the rocks and coral; however, it will actively hunt on land for Slowpoke tails.

However, it consistently appears as a black, spherical Pokémon surrounded by a purple haze. Gastly has a wide, pink mouth with two visible fangs. Though its eyes seem to extend past its round body, visible eyelids surround them.\n\nIt produces a faint, sweet smell. The toxic gas surrounding the main body can induce fainting and suffocation, and it is capable of enshrouding an enemy of any size. Gastly's gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pokémon in existence. The Pokémon the Series episode The Tower of Terror suggests that Gastly has a playful personality, often frightening and playing pranks on people for fun. However, in the episode A Shipful of Shivers, it shows a willingness to preserve or pass on the memories of departed humans. It is also shown in The Ghost of Maiden's Peak changing form and creating illusions, and it is capable of phasing through solid objects and forming tangible hands out of its gasses. Gastly can be found within caves and old, dilapidated buildings, but may also be seen outdoors during nighttime. Its gaseous body will dwindle away when exposed to strong winds, so they huddle together in decent-sized groups under house eaves to avoid the wind. It may also cause flickering lights in abandoned houses. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Gastly is known to sleep while floating.A sleeping Gastly is said give a sudden surprise should someone approach it.\n\nIn Generation I, Night Shade was its signature move."

Haunter's gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pokémon in existence.\n\nHaunter hides in very dark places, such as caves, and is afraid of light. If a human or a Pokémon comes near Haunter, it will stalk the victim while floating and beckon it to come closer. Once approached it will then lick the victim with its gaseous tongue, inflicting convulsions in the victim that last until death. It can also float through walls. It has been shown in Pokémon the Series that it can control its hands from far away and can control any Pokémon that it touches with its hands. Haunter have also been depicted as being able to create illusions, pull out spirits from an individual’s body, and even remove its own eyes from its face.

As seen in the Pokémon Stadium series, Onix is capable of rotating its head, or any part of its body, in a full 360 degrees. It is a very aggressive Pokémon that will constantly attack humans and other Pokémon when in pain, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode To Master the Onixpected!. As seen in the Pokémon Adventures manga, Onix can be separated from its body segments in battle and be fine later on, either regenerating or reattaching to its body segments. It is said that an Onix that lives for about 100 years will evolve into a Steelix after its composition becomes more diamond-like. It can be found in mountains and caves.

Its strong shell covers the outside of its body, featuring a red upper half and a light tan lower half. Its upper half is topped with six tall, thin spikes that resemble a crown. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower half doubles as its jaw with six fangs overlapping its upper body. Its two outer fangs are much larger than the inner four and are roughly half as tall as Kingler's entire body. Its hips visibly protrude from its lower body and connect to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. Kingler's main features are its orange pincers. Its left claw is roughly twice as large as the other and is as hard as steel.\n\nKingler is often found on the edges of water, usually the ocean. Its powerful claws have 10,000 horsepower and are capable of prying open the shells of Shellder and Cloyster. While Kingler's large, left claw is its main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that Kingler can barely lift it. It causes balancing problems and Kingler may quickly become fatigued from continuous use. However, it has been shown to communicate with other Kingler by waving its pincers around.\n\nPrior to Generation III, Kingler and its pre-evolved form, Krabby, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Crabhammer."

It evolves into Hisuian Electrode when exposed to a Leaf Stone.\nVoltorb is a spherical Pokémon that resembles a buttonless Poké Ball with eyes. The top half is red, while the bottom half is white. Because of its resemblance to Poké Balls, it is thought that it was created when one was exposed to an energy pulse. This is supported by the fact that its components do not occur naturally.\n\nVoltorb is generally found in power plants and other areas with electric fields where it feeds. It was first discovered in the plant where modern Poké Balls were invented. It has a volatile temperament and will explode if agitated or bumped by the slightest contact. Due to being constantly mistaken as a Poké Ball, Voltorb has reportedly zapped many humans as a result."

However, unlike Voltorb, Electrode can control its explosive ability at will. This unpredictable and explosive nature has earned it the nickname of \"Bomb Ball\". Because of its appearance, many Trainers try to pick Electrode up, mistaking it for an item."

Each \"head\" has a slightly different facial expression, but each face has triangular eyes with tiny black pupils and a small mouth. Each shell has some cracks, and one member of the bundle usually has its yellow insides or brain exposed. More numerous cracks are a sign that it is close to evolution. Despite looking like eggs, Exeggcute is actually more closely related to plant seeds. It is believed to carry genes of plants and other species.\n\nExeggcute gather in swarms of six. The heads communicate with each other by using a form of telepathy that only they can understand. Should the number of Exeggcute be reduced to less than six, the remaining Exeggcute will attempt to replace it with a similarly sized Pokémon as seen in the Pikachu short Pikachu's Rescue Adventure. It needs six Exeggcute in order to stay balanced or else it becomes nervous and cowardly. Pidgeotto and Crabrawler are its natural predators, which it chases off with psychokinesis. Exeggcute inhabits jungles and forests. Exeggcute in the Alola region tend to be heavier than those from elsewhere.

Its body and legs are light brown with thin black rings and its legs are thick with two-toed feet. There is a light yellow paw pad on each foot's underside. It has thin, green leaves sprouting from the top of its body. Exeggutor has three round, light yellow heads that resemble coconuts, each with different facial expressions.\n\nExeggutor's heads think independently and don't appear interested in one another, so it makes a lot of noise as each head speaks its mind. They still appear to get along, though, for they never squabble amongst themselves. If all the heads want to go in a different direction, its body is unable to move. They are able to communicate telepathically as well and sometimes use it to come to a joint decision. It uses psychic powers to fight, and since all three heads are capable its power is tripled. If one of these heads grows too large, it falls off and groups together with others to become an Exeggcute. In the Pokémon the Series episode The March of the Exeggutor Squad, Exeggutor also has been seen in groups of its own kind, meaning that it is not a solitary Pokémon. Exeggutor has been referred to as \"The Walking Tropical Rainforest\" or \"The Walking Jungle\". It can be sluggish during cloudy days due to the lack of sunlight. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Exeggutor is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and jungles.\n\nExeggutor and its pre-evolved form, Exeggcute, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Barrage."

Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot make up its toes. It has two small spikes on its back and a short tail. On its head, Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet. Because of this, much of its actual face has never been seen, except for its triangular, black (sometimes green or blue) eyes and a small area surrounding them, and in its Bandai Namco card a bit of its mouth, where it has a pair of a few sharp teeth and a long pink tongue. The skull has two rounded horns on the top of its head and a tooth-like point on the lower sides. Under the skull, Cubone has a brown snout. This small Pokémon survives only through the immense skill it possesses in wielding the bone it carries as a weapon.\n\nIt is called the Lonely Pokémon because of its tendency to keep to itself and avoid social situations, due to the trauma caused by the death of its Marowak mother. Cubone will often weep at night in mourning of its mother. When Cubone cries, the skull that it wears on its head vibrates and emits \"a plaintive and mournful sound.\" On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. Cubone seems to recognize a likeness of its mother in the full moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness. Its cries attract Mandibuzz, its natural predator, who uses this Pokémon's bones to decorate itself and its nest. It is said a Cubone will evolve into a Marowak once it comes to terms with the pain of its mother's death. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Cubone is known to cry while sleeping. It is theorized that Cubone's dreams are about its deceased mother. The dreams Cubone have make it cry, but crying makes it stronger. Cubone lives in rocky areas, usually on mountains or in caves. It also once inhabited the Pokémon Tower in Lavender Town where deceased Pokémon were buried and mourned. One such Cubone's mother is shown as a ghost there.\n\nCubone and its evolved form, Marowak, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Bone Club and Bonemerang.

Despite its small size, Marowak's body is as sturdy as armor. Upon evolution, Marowak has overcome the grief of its mother's passing. Now ferocious and violent, Marowak is an adept combatant that uses the bone it carries as a weapon and a boomerang. Having evolved, it seeks vengeance on its natural enemy Mandibuzz, which prey on Cubone because of its naturally weak and timid demeanor. Marowak has also been recorded pounding on boulders with the bone club it carries to tap out messages to others. It lives in mountains to test its skills. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Marowak is known to sleep while using its bone similar to a pillow, possibly being at peace.

Lacking a distinct neck and head, its upper torso has almond-shaped eyes with black space around them and appears to lack a nose and mouth. Primarily brown, it has cream-colored, segmented arms and legs. Each hand has three fingers and each foot has three clawed toes. The soles of its feet and its ankles have circular, yellow pads. Hitmonlee is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart.\n\nHitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring (and one particular Hitmonlee can do this with its arms as well). The source of its power comes from the ligaments in its legs that Hitmonlee can fully control. This flexibility allows Hitmonlee to run with lengthy strides, giving it greater reach for its kicks. Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position. Hitmonlee's kicking strength is incredibly powerful owing to its diamond-like soles. Right before kicking an opponent, Hitmonlee will harden the muscles on the sole of its foot, allowing it to maximize the full power of its kick. It has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Kick Master\". After battling, it rubs down its legs to relax the tight muscles. Rarely found in the wild, it is primarily found in urban areas. It has been seen competing with either Hitmonchan, or Hitmontop.\n\nHitmonlee has had several kicking moves as signature moves:\n\nPrior to Generation V, Reckless was Hitmonlee's signature Ability."

In between the tunic and kilt is a small, black area.\n\nAs its appearance suggests, Hitmonchan specializes in punching. It can throw punches that are too quick to be seen with the naked eye. Its punches are said to be as fast as a bullet train. It starts attacking foes with combo punches from both sides before finishing with a single straight punch. A single straight punch by Hitmonchan can launch foes over 300 mph. By punching with a corkscrew motion, it is even capable of drilling through concrete. Even a light graze from its punches will result in a burn. However, Hitmonchan requires a break every three minutes while fighting.

There is a yellow spot on its palms and the soles of its feet. It has beady eyes and a long, prehensile tongue, with nerves that extend its entire length. The tongue is likely connected to its tail, which twitches and retracts when the tongue is pulled.\n\nAt over 6 feet 6 inches (2 meters), Lickitung's tongue is twice as long as its body. Sticky, smelly saliva coats its tongue, which causes a tingling sensation when touched and can cause rashes if not cleaned off. It is used for capturing prey (mainly Bug-type Pokémon), reaching for berries, exploring its environment, attacking, and cleaning; although the effectiveness of its cleaning is questionable as its saliva leaves behind its smell. Lickitung's saliva can also be used as a strong adhesive after cooking it. Lickitung remembers things by their texture and taste, although it apparently dislikes sour things. The tongue is both dexterous and powerful enough to lift people, as seen in the Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Deceit and Assist.

It has vacant eyes and a wide mouth that usually has two pointed teeth in the upper jaw. However, a full set of teeth is shown in the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Rocking the Virbank Gym! Part 1. Below its face is a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking. Several geyser-like protrusions, which usually release a mustard-colored gas, cover this Pokémon's body. Koffing's purple skin is very thin, and over-inflation can cause it to explode. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depicts Koffing as having a hollow body.\n\nKoffing creates gases within its body by mixing toxins with garbage, and produces more gas in higher temperatures. These gases are malodorous and cause sniffles, coughs, and teary eyes to those around them. The gases are also lighter than air, allowing Koffing to hover. When agitated, it creates a more toxic gas and expels it through the holes in its body. As shown in the Pokémon the Series episode Pokémon Emergency!, Koffing's gas can be ignited by fire or electricity. It feeds on the fumes of raw, rotting trash found in gas dumps and polluted air.

The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short time span because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.\n\nEach of Weezing's heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing's gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.\n\nWeezing lives in urban areas. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing's body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases.

If the baby is awake but the parent wants to sleep, Kangaskhan will lie down to sleep while the baby sits on top of its back. They are known to raise other species of Pokémon alongside their own children, and records exist which describe a childless Kangaskhan raising a lost human child. Regardless of how badly injured it becomes, the mother will not cease fighting until its young is safe. It uses quick jabs to intimidate its enemies. Although it was nearly hunted to extinction, Kangaskhan can be found in savannahs and other grasslands.\n\nPrior to Generation III, Dizzy Punch was its signature move."

Refer to Game data→Evolution data for these details.)\nHorsea is a light blue, piscine Pokémon that is similar to a seahorse. It has red eyes, a long, tubular mouth, and three spike-like fins on either side of its head. Its ridged belly and single dorsal fin are cream-colored. Highly adept in the water, it uses its dorsal fin to swim in any direction while facing forward. It has a tightly curled tail that it can use as both a balance and an anchor when caught in a strong current. In safer environments, it uses its tail to play with other members of its species.\n\nHorsea feeds on insects and moss gathered from rocks. If Horsea senses danger, it sprays water or dense black ink from its mouth at its attacker. It can shoot more precisely at insects flying above the surface of the water. Horsea nests in coral reefs and islands throughout oceans with gentle currents. Many Eggs are laid every year, and the young are raised by the male Horsea rather than the female. Horsea swims with dance-like motions, creating whirlpools in the process. Horsea tend to compete with each other to see who can create the biggest whirlpool."

It has a pair of dorsal fins with sharp, cream-colored tips that exude venom. Seadra's venom is toxic enough to induce numbness and even fainting in humans, but it is still prized among practitioners of traditional medicine.\n\nSeadra can swim in any direction while facing forward by rapidly flapping its fins and tail. It catches its prey by spinning its body to create large whirlpools. When its prey is exhausted, Seadra swallows it whole using its long snout. Seadra makes its nest by either wriggling between or anchoring itself to branches of coral under the ocean. After a female Seadra gives birth, the male Seadra will take care of the young. It is markedly vicious and will mercilessly attack those who venture near its nest. During this time, the male's venom also becomes thicker and stronger than usual."

It competes with others of its kind to determine which has the strongest, thickest horn. Humans swimming near it must exercise caution lest Goldeen rams them. Goldeen is a very common sight in any body of fresh water, including ponds, lakes, and rivers. It can be seen swimming upstream in large schools during the breeding season in spring. Its strong fins allow it to maintain a steady speed of five knots while swimming upstream. It is known as the \"Water Dancer\" due to its elegant movements in the water.

It has billowing pectoral fins and a pair of tail fins shaped like butterfly wings, all of which are white speckled with black. However, its dorsal fin is pure white and rigid.\n\nSeaking is a very powerful swimmer that is found in rivers and streams. It can swim not only against a river's current, but up waterfalls as well. In the autumn spawning season, it grows fatter and more vibrant. It travels upriver where male Seaking engage in elaborate dances to court females. The female would go for the Seaking with the most graceful dance.\n\nSeaking uses its powerful horn to bore holes in riverbed boulders in order to shelter its Eggs from water currents. A mated pair take turns patrolling around their new nest for roughly a month and defend it with their lives. There are two different groups of Trainers who are obsessed with Seaking's horns or dorsal fins. However, the groups cannot get along with each other.

These appendages surround an exterior organ called the core. The core resembles a golden metal casing with a red gem in the center, which is held in place by a golden ring looped around Staryu's lower left point. Staryu have no jointed limbs to speak of, instead using their psychic powers to move themselves around. If any of Staryu's appendages are lost or eaten by predators like Lumineon, it is unharmed and can grow them back with ease provided the core is still intact.\n\nWhen the sun goes down, Staryu's core glows its brightest. Many Staryu will float from the seafloor to the surface and align themselves with stars of the night sky as their core flickers, displaying a connection with the celestial bodies of space. In the Pokémon the Series: The Beginning episode Bye Bye Psyduck, it is shown that if Staryu becomes weak, its core will grow faint and flash slowly. During the ends of summer, groups of Staryu tend to gather while lighting up in a steady rhythm. Staryu can be found at the very bottom of the ocean on the seafloors. There are times, however, when Staryu finds itself in rivers that lead into the ocean as seen in Pokémon Snap. In Generation III, Camouflage was its signature move.\n\nIn the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, and the original Japanese version of the Pokémon the Series: The Beginning episode The Water Flowers of Cerulean City, Staryu is classified as hermaphroditic."

The front starfish has a golden formation in the center. In the center of the golden casing is its red jewel core, which can glow in seven colors and has developed to resemble a cut precious stone. The second starfish is semi-attached to the back of the first and can spin 360 degrees. This rotational action is how Starmie swims through the ocean. It can also launch itself out of the water and fly through the air for short periods, as seen in Pokémon Snap.\n\nFrom its core, Starmie can emit electrical waves that are powerful enough to reach the furthest parts of the universe. The multi-color glowing of its core is also believed to be a method of communication with other members of its species. As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode The Water Flowers of Cerulean City, the core will go dark if Starmie is knocked unconscious and will sometimes flicker if Starmie is low on health. Because of its body shape and habit of sending transmissions skyward, some people believe this Pokémon to be extraterrestrial. It has been known to cause headaches on people when approached. It is rarely seen in the wild since it requires a rare evolution stone to evolve, but it can be found in the deepest parts of the ocean. It feeds by absorbing tiny plankton into its body while swimming, and it is preyed on by Lumineon."

Its arms end in large, white scythes, which it uses for both hunting and fighting. Two pairs of cream-colored wings extend from its back. While these wings do allow Scyther to fly, it rarely does so. Scyther's thighs have large, upward-pointing spikes. Its feet are tall, rounded, and conical, almost extending to its thighs; each foot ends in three small, white claws on its front side.\n\nScyther is an adept hunter that tears at its prey with its scythes. Thanks to its green coloration, it can camouflage itself well in the grasslands and forests where it lives. Humans rarely encounter wild Scyther in these areas, however. Said to be like a ninja, Scyther can move so quickly that it cannot be followed, increasing the effectiveness of its scythes. It maintains the sharpness of its blades through battle as well as by cutting through hard objects, such as trees; it can cut down a massive tree with just a single slice, although it cannot penetrate Tarountula's elastic threads. The Pokémon the Series episode Tracey Gets Bugged showed that wild Scyther form swarms with a single leader chosen through combat. When a challenger successfully defeats a current leader and replaces it, the defeated leader is exiled from the swarm. In Showdown at Dark City, it was shown that Scyther becomes aggressive when faced with the color red."

Despite this, it is able to learn the kicking move Triple Axel. It has white arms and five-fingered purple hands. Jynx is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\n\nOriginally, its face was colored black. Pokémon Stadium's fainting animation had it disappear, leaving only its hair behind and implying that what appears to be dark-colored skin is actually just darkness.\n\nJynx has a language that sounds similar to human speech and includes several cry patterns. However, this language has yet to be deciphered. It prefers to communicate by using dance-like movements. There are some musicians who compose songs for Jynx to sing. These rhythmic movements often cause people to dance along with it. The Jynx in Alola are said to have wonderful precise movements.

There is a large, lightning bolt-shaped stripe on Electabuzz's chest, a V-shaped stripe on its forehead, one stripe on its side, a thick stripe down its back, two bands on each leg, several broken bands on each arm, and many rings around its long tail. There are three clawed toes on each of its feet, two in front and one in back, and five fingers on each hand.\n\nIn the dark, Electabuzz will glow light blue from the electrical charges running across its body. It is constantly leaking more electricity than it consumes. Bearing near an Electabuzz will cause a human's hair to stand on end. Electabuzz often gathered groups around tall trees to wait for the upcoming storm. During torrential thunderstorms, Electabuzz will compete to find locations likely to be struck by lightning to absorb the electric power. Electabuzz is often used as an alternative to lightning rods because it is unharmed by the absorption of electricity. It is also capable of entirely nonverbal communication via electrical currents when near another of its species. Blackouts have been known to happen when groups of Electabuzz gather to consume electricity from power plants, they often get blamed for the occurring power outages. As a result, Ground-type Pokémon are kept around power plants to keep Electabuzz from raiding, although the blackouts are usually the fault of the electric companies, not Electabuzz. There is ongoing research on using Electabuzz to store away lightning until it is needed to be used later.\n\nAs demonstrated in the Pokémon the Series episode Showdown at Dark City, Electabuzz is sent into a rage by the color red. In battle, Electabuzz windmills its arms, apparently to add momentum to its punches. This method of battle seems ineffective, as opponents can escape in the meantime. Electabuzz typically resides near power plants and can cause blackouts in cities, though it can also be found in grasslands."

Down its back is a row of red spikes, and there is a flame at the tip of its tapering, yellow tail.\n\nMagmar's body temperature is nearly 2,200° Fahrenheit (1,200° Celsius), giving its body an orange glow. Because it hates cold places, this Pokémon typically resides in and around active volcanoes where it is born from. This Pokémon has even been known to spit scorching flames to establish an ideally warm environment for itself. The Magmar found in Alola are said to be sturdier than Magmar found elsewhere.\n\nIn battle, Magmar blows out intense flames from all over its body to intimidate its foes and incinerate its surroundings. The Pokémon the Series episode Riddle Me This has shown that extremely well-trained Magmar can block Electric-type attacks with super-heated air. However, an outmatched Magmar will quickly retreat, using its fiery camouflage and its wavering, rippling glare to blend into any present fires. As stated in the 23rd chapter of Pokémon Adventures, Magmar is very persistent and will hunt down anyone who manages to defeat it. It is able to heal its wounds and weariness by soaking in lava. Magmar has a bad habit of unintentionally burning its prey to a crisp. Its body is always constantly burning. Magmar is feared as one of the many causes of fires."

On top of its head is a large pair of gray, spiky pincers on top of its head. In its mouth are many long, flat teeth arranged horizontally and it has triangular eyes. Capable of seeing color to some degree, Pinsir appears to be attracted to the color green. Its legs are short and thick, while its arms are long and thin. It has three claws on each hand and foot; two of its toes face forward and one backward.\n\nPinsir can use its pincers to crush, toss, bludgeon, or tear opponents; lift things twice its weight; and shatter logs. Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of Pinsir's horns and will not be released until they are torn in half. Pinsir's horns are quite flexible as depicted in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards where they have a wide range of motion. In addition to hunting prey, it's shown in the Pokémon the Series episode A Sappy Ending that it enjoys tree sap. Pinsir lives deep in the temperate forests and jungles, where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile. In Pokémon Sleep, Pinsir burrows itself into the ground to sleep during cold nights but its pincers can be seen sticking out of the ground as it slumbers. In Alola, it has a rivalry with Vikavolt and gets along with Heracross. Pinsir are known to judge each other based on their pincers. The pincers determine its popularity with the opposite gender based on how more thick and impressive it looks."

It has large, vacant eyes and pink lips. Its pectoral and tail fins are white. On its back is a stiff, three-peaked yellow fin, resembling a crown; there is an identical fin on its underside. It also has long barbels. The barbels are white on a female and pale-yellow on a male. A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle, it will do nothing but flop around. It is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led scientists to research this species.\n\nMagikarp is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability, it usually lives downstream of the water's flow. In Generation I, Splash was its signature move. It is often seen using Splash to leap out of the water, which makes it an easy target for predators such as Pidgeotto and Pidgeot. Frillish is also known to prey on Magikarp.\n\nIn Hoppy Town, there are at least 31 unique pattern varieties of Magikarp, with their scales coming in colors such as gray, black, white, purple, pink, violet, apricot, and brown. These patterns can be classified by groups, depending on how the Magikarp looks while it is still small; a specific pattern arises when it becomes bigger. Which patterns can be caught depend on the type of Old Rod; the better the rod, the more groups of patterns can be fished. The people in Hoppy Town train their Magikarp to jump the highest in order to compete in a series of Leagues to win prizes."

Gyarados's tail fin is similar in structure to the crest on its head, except with a thin, white fin spread between the points.\n\nThe process of evolution causes a change in its brain structure that is believed to cause its violent nature. Gyarados's fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. Gyarados is feared for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies since ancient times. In some regions, Gyarados is called the \"deity of destruction\" because of this. It appears in times of conflict and destroys the surrounding area. Its rampages have been known to last a month at a time. These rampages can occur even during a harsh storm. A Gyarados's rage won't stop completely until everything is destroyed. Some believed any human settlement is fated to be destroyed should a Gyarados appear. Gyarados lives in both fresh and salty waters. Both Gyarados and its Mega form have demonstrated in Pokémon Chronicles and Pokémon the Series that it can leap huge distances both from the water and from the ground, usually several times its own body length. However, Gyarados is rarely seen in the wild. The move Hyper Beam is often associated with Gyarados due to it being being powerful enough to instantly destroy everything it hits."

Ditto (Japanese: メタモン Metamon) is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\n\nDitto is well known for its unique ability to breed with any Pokémon other than the Pokémon in the No Eggs Discovered group and other Ditto, including some gender-unknown Pokémon, to produce Eggs of the other's species.\nIn its natural state, Ditto is a light-purple or pink blob-like Pokémon with vestigial facial features. It is often referred to as amorphous, but has a relatively consistent appearance in official artwork, including two small nubs on its \"head\", a few soft lumps at its base, and two pseudopod-like protrusions in place of arms. The face consists of beady eyes and a simple mouth; almost always pulled into a smile.\n\nDitto bears a variety of unusual and often entirely unique traits that set it apart from every other Pokémon. It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object or living creature, including its form and abilities. Each Ditto has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming; being unable to remain transformed while laughing and getting details of its transformation wrong if based on memory being apparently universal. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depict Ditto being able to transform separate sections of its body into parts from multiple Pokémon at once. In the Pokémon the Series episode Ditto's Mysterious Mansion, as well as in the TCG and some spin-off games, it is shown that occasionally Ditto cannot change its face during transformation; a trait that has become synonymous with the species despite being incongruous with their depiction in core series games. While its transformation ability allows it to get along with almost anything, it does not get along with its own kind, which it will quickly (and generally fruitlessly) attempt to transform into. It is shown to be able to transform into humans as well; however, it cannot mimic human speech. It transforms into a rock when sleeping to avoid being attacked. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Ditto is known to sleep while still transformed into either a rock or Pokémon.On very rare occasions, a sleeping Ditto will transform back to normal when it is relaxed. Ditto is never far from civilization or people, and is the only Pokémon capable of using the Metal Powder and Quick Powder items. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Imposter as an Ability. In The Indigo Disk, various Ditto Blocks can be found as objectives in Blueberry Quests throughout the Terarium, where Ditto will seemingly transform into one of the many cubes with rounded edges that make up many of the structures of the Terarium. Despite being milestones for the player to obtain, and not actually obtainable themselves, they can still be Shiny."

It also serves as the player's first Pokémon in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pokémon Conquest. It also is the first Pokémon employee in Pokémon Café Mix. In Pokémon Yellow, Professor Oak had originally intended to give Eevee to the player as their first Pokémon, but it is taken by Blue instead.\nEevee is a small, mammalian, quadrupedal Pokémon with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose.\n\nEevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns. It is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving. Eevee can potentially evolve into eight different Evolutions. Eevee can also start to adopt the face of the Trainer that owns it. Eevee's genes are believed to have the key to solving the mysteries of Pokémon Evolution. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Eevee is believed to dream about which form it will evolve into.\n\nEevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Extreme Evoboost."

Vaporeon's body is light blue with a dark blue marking around its head and a spiky ridge down its spine. It has black eyes and a tiny black nose. There is a white fin encircling its neck and three fins with cream-colored webbing on its head. Two of these fins are on either side of its head, similar to ears; and one is directly on top of its head, resembling a dorsal fin. Vaporeon is a quadruped with three small toes on each foot and dark blue paw pads on the hind feet. Its split tail fin has been mistaken for a mermaid's in the past and is believed to be the origin of mermaid folklore. It can detect moisture with its fins, which vibrate when sensing incoming rain.\n\nVaporeon is mostly found in urban settings under the ownership of a Trainer. It is rarely seen in the wild, but it prefers clean freshwater lakes and shores. It has developed gills to become better suited to an aquatic lifestyle, and its cell composition's similarity to water allows it to melt into the water. This ability enables Vaporeon to remain camouflaged while swimming, hiding itself from enemies and allowing it to ambush its prey: fish Pokémon."

It has slender legs and small paws, each with three toes and a pink paw-pad.\n\nJolteon creates electricity using an organ in its lungs, which causes crackling noises as it exhales. It can also generate low-level electricity in its cells, which is amplified by the negative ions it gathers and generates in its fur, allowing it to discharge 10,000-volt lightning bolts. Jolteon's prickly fur is made of electrically charged needles, which create a sparking noise as it moves. It is capable of launching its fur at enemies when agitated or startled; the charge is so powerful that it can remain on the shed fur for a long time. This Pokémon is most often found in cities and towns under the ownership of Trainers. However, its high-strung nature and tendency toward mood swings can make it difficult to train. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, the crackling sound of electricity can be heard while Jolteon exhales during its slumber."

If its body gets too hot, it will fluff out the fur on its collar to cool down. Flareon stores and heats inhaled air in its flame sac, and then exhales it as fire with temperatures of around 3,100 °F (1,700 °C). Flareon's average body temperature is around 1,300-1,500 °F (700-800 °C), but it can reach 1,700 °F (900 °C). It is an omnivore that roasts either Berries or prey before consumption. Flareon has a curious personality, and is mostly found in populated areas, rarely seen in the wilderness. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, it is believed that Flareon is regulating its body temperature while sleeping. Due its fur releasing heat to help cool it down, Flareon is able to sleep comfortably."

In 3D games, such as Pokémon Stadium, it can open its beak and can detach its limbs and head from its torso. According to its Pokédex entries, it has copy protection built into its code, preventing duplication through electronic means. It was created in 1995 by Silph Co., but documents at Silph Co. claim it was created at the Pokémon Lab on Cinnabar Island using the state-of-the-art technology of its time. Because it was created decades ago, many of its parts have since become obsolete. It was the first artificial Pokémon to have ever been created through computer programming. In ancient Hisui, people were confused about Porygon and its evolutions due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time.\n\nDue to its man-made origins, Porygon does not need to breathe or eat, though it can still accept food if given. It has the ability to convert its body into digital data, allowing it to travel through cyberspace. Recently, it has become more helpful inside cyberspace by searching for any suspicious data that exists. Some believed Porygon has the power to potentially travel in space despite the species not displaying that ability yet. Because it is man-made, it is generally found in computers or in labs and other buildings where people work.\n\nPorygon and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Conversion and Conversion 2. Prior to Generation V, Sharpen was also one of its signature moves. Additionally, prior to Generation V and in Generation IX, Porygon and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Download as an Ability. It can use Conversion to change its appearance to mimic another Pokémon's and has also demonstrated the ability to change color for camouflage."

Omastar swam the seas in search of prey, including prehistoric Shellder. It attacks only when prey comes near its tentacles. Omastar uses its tentacles to ensnare its prey before biting down with the deadly force of its beak. Its fangs are powerful enough to crush through rocks. With the shell broken, it would suck out the contents. Omastar was in turn preyed upon by Carracosta. Omastar is thought to be a distant ancestor to Octillery."

As a result, Dragonair has been referred as a \"divine Pokémon\" since ancient times by agricultural peoples. Dragonair is a rare Pokémon that inhabits pristine seas and lakes. The lakes Dragonair lives in are usually filled with offerings from people in gratitude. It is said that a person who sees a Dragonair at the start of a year will be healthy for the whole year. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dragonair is known to channel power and change the weather even while it sleeps.\n\nIn Generation II, Dragonair and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."

    "solution": "This is dragonite, and is a Dragon/Flying-type Pokemon. Dragonite (Japanese: カイリュー Kairyu) is a dual-type Dragon/Flying pseudo-legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt evolves from Dragonair starting at level 55. It is the final form of Dratini.\nDragonite is a draconic, bipedal reptilian Pokémon with light orange skin. It has large, grayish-green eyes and a round snout with small nostrils. A pair of long, thin antennae sprout from the top of its head with a small horn set between them. Its striated underbelly is cream-colored and extends from its neck to the tip of its long, tapering tail. It has thick arms and legs ending in three claws each. The leg joints are well defined, while its arms have a smooth, rounded appearance. Dragonite's wings are small relative to its body with teal wing membranes. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Dragonite is known to sleep soundly while displaying its belly. This rare sight is said to be an exhausted Dragonite resting after flying over the vast seas.\n\nDespite its bulky build, Dragonite is capable of flying faster than the speed of sound, being able to circle the globe in sixteen hours. A kind-hearted Pokémon with human-like intelligence, Dragonite shows signs of altruism: it is said to save humans from drowning and lead lost or foundering ships to safety. As demonstrated in Great Bowls of Fire!, however, it will go on an uncontrollable, destructive rampage if its environment is threatened. Dragonite will usually calm down and be satisfied after smashing down anything that has angered it to smithereens. It is known to engage in fierce battles with Kingdra whenever they meet. Dragonite has been referred to as the \"sea guardian\" and the \"Sea Incarnate\"; as such, there are many ships with figureheads decorated with Dragonite's look. Drayden stated in Thrash of the Titans! that Dragonite's power is capable of affecting the weather. In Fiore, Dragonite used by Pokémon Rangers to travel to different areas in the region, this flying service is called the Dragonite Bus.\n\nDragonite is very rare in the wild, typically living near the sea. In fact, An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS categorises the Dragonite family alongside Legendary Pokémon. Some claim that there is an island somewhere in the ocean that only Dragonite inhabit.\n\nIn Generation II, Dragonite and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."

    "solution": "This is mewtwo, and is a Psychic/Fighting-type Pokemon. Mewtwo (Japanese: ミュウツー Mewtwo) is a Psychic-type Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nWhile it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Mewtwo can Mega Evolve into two different forms:\n\nIt is associated with Mew, and thus they are collectively referred to as the Mew duo by fans.\nMewtwo is an artificial Pokémon. It is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon with some feline features. Its body is primarily gray with a long, purple tail and a large purple underbelly. On top of its head are two short, blunt horns, and it has purple eyes. A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base but thins before ending in a small bulb.\n\nAccording to journals found in Kanto's Pokémon Mansion, after discovering the Mythical Pokémon Mew and gathering some of its DNA, Mr. Fuji used it in his mansion to create Mewtwo, a modified clone of Mew with the goal to making it the most powerful Pokémon of all. It was held and studied in the mansion, where it acquired extreme power and a vicious disposition after enduring horrific gene-splicing experiments. It eventually broke free and fled the Mansion, destroying it in the process. It is widely known as one of the most powerful Pokémon in existence and is said to have the most savage heart among all Pokémon, lacking compassion and striking fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes. Mewtwo conserves energy by remaining motionless in order to unleash its full power in battle. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate opponent in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. Though rarely seen in the wild, it is said to be resting in dark caves somewhere.\n\nIn Mewtwo Strikes Back, Mewtwo was shown to be capable of levitation, mind control, memory erasure, telepathy, teleporting others to another location, and the creation of powerful storms. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. As shown in POKÉMON Detective Pikachu, Mewtwo can also transfer a human's soul into a Pokémon's body provided that said Pokémon is in a crazed state, causing this person to gain control of the Pokémon's body and abilities. It possesses a rivalry with Mew. As seen in Genesect and the Legend Awakened, Mewtwo can breathe in outer space.\n\nIn the Pokémon Adventures manga, Mewtwo's creation wasn't possible with the amount of Mew's cells gathered, so to complete it, human cells were used instead, specifically from the Team Rocket scientist Blaine. Due to Blaine possessing some of Mewtwo's cells as well, the two became linked, which granted Blaine to ability to track its whereabouts at the cost of slowly taking his life.\n\nMewtwo is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Psystrike.\n\nA unique variant of Mewtwo, called Shadow Mewtwo, is very similar to standard Mewtwo, but with dark gray skin, a dark gray tail with a yellowish orange tip, and a shard of Shadow Synergy Stone coming out of its shoulder. In the past, Anne was almost possessed by a Shadow Synergy Stone but was saved by Mewtwo, whom the Shadow Synergy Stone took control of and merged with instead. Under the stone's influence, Shadow Mewtwo travelled around Ferrum, draining Gaia Power from other normal Synergy Stones, which continuously increases its power."

Mew (Japanese: ミュウ Mew) is a Psychic-type Mythical Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\n\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\n\nMew is notable for its unique ability to learn every Technical Machine, Technical Record, Hidden Machine, and Move Tutor move (except those exclusive to a particular Pokémon or group of Pokémon, such as Volt Tackle and Secret Sword).\n\nIt is associated with Mewtwo, and thus they are collectively referred to as the Mew duo by fans.\n\nMew was first officially revealed in the May 1996 issue of CoroCoro, less than two months after Pokémon Red and Green were released in Japan.\nMew is a pink, bipedal Pokémon with mammalian features. It has a rounded, wide snout; triangular ears; and large, blue eyes. It has short arms with three-fingered paws and large hind paws with oval markings on the soles. Its tail is long and thin with an ovoid tip. Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope.\n\nMew has shown a playful, childish personality, showing signs of high intelligence, curiosity, shyness, playfulness, and even selflessness. It is said to have the DNA of every single Pokémon contained within its body. This causes many scientists to theorize that Mew is the ancestor of all Pokémon. It is an incredibly adaptable species, capable of levitation and teleportation. It can use almost all known moves, regardless of their types. It has also shown the rare power to transform into all known Pokémon. It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people. As seen on several occasions, it has the ability to create an orb of energy around itself for protection, which can come in many colors, such as green, yellow, and pink.\n\nAccording to journals found in Kanto's Pokémon Mansion, Mr. Fuji is the one who discovered Mew deep in the jungle and coined its name. With other scientists, he managed to gather some of Mew's DNA and used it in his mansion to create a modified clone of it, aiming it to be the most powerful Pokémon of all, which resulted in the birth of the Legendary Pokémon Mewtwo. Since Mew can make itself invisible, very few people have seen it, leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be nothing, but a mirage. However, sightings of it are still being reported to this day, confirming its existence. Even though it's rarely seen, it will willingly show itself to a person who is pure of heart and has a strong desire to see it.\n\nAccording to the Pokémon the Series-related radio drama, The Birth of Mewtwo, Mew was discovered by Jessie's mother, Miyamoto, who registered its cry in a forest 20 years before the events of the series. It was worshiped for its protection by ancient people who created a song in its honor and believed it appeared once a year with the rising sun. It wasn't rediscovered until 18 years after Miyamoto met Mew by sunrise on the peak of a high mountain. As depicted in the episode In the Palms of our Hands! it is capable of splitting itself up and transforming into more than one Pokémon at the same time. It was also shown to possess a strong rivalry with its clone, Mewtwo in Mewtwo Strikes Back.\n\nMew is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Genesis Supernova."

The leaf is also used to sense temperature and humidity. Chikorita actively seeks out and enjoys the sun's warmth. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Chikorita uses the leaf to search for the coziest place to sleep in. On occasion, Chikorita can be seen relaxing as it sleeps due to finding a great spot. Chikorita can be found in grasslands. However, due to its status as a first partner Pokémon, a wild Chikorita is hard to come by and it is generally found under the ownership of Trainers.

Ledyba (Japanese: レディバ Rediba) is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation II.\n\nIt evolves into Ledian starting at level 18.\nLedyba is a coleopteran insectoid Pokémon that resembles a ladybug. Its elytra are red with five black spots; this pattern differs slightly for each individual. The wings themselves are transparent. Its main body and lower jaw are yellow, while the rest of its head is red. It has large, round eyes and a pair of black antennae. The antennae are shorter on the female than on the male. It has six black legs with white hands that resemble boxing gloves.\n\nLedyba is a social Pokémon that is active in large groups. If left alone, it becomes timid and afraid to move. It is also very sensitive to cold, so it forms clusters with other Ledyba for warmth. An aromatic fluid is secreted from its feet and leg joints, which it uses for communication. The fluid indicates its location and conveys emotion; it will smell sour if Ledyba is angry. In the Pokémon the Series episode The Whistle Stop, Ledyba is shown to serve a role in pollinating fruit-producing plants and is usually instructed to do so by means of a special whistle. However, like most Pokémon, it will also respond to regular vocal commands. Ledyba builds its nest on leaves in temperate forests and jungles and joins with other Ledyba to protect its home when needed. As shown in Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon and Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX, they sleep in groups of four."

It has long, pointed ears, yellow eyes with red pupils, and a small mouth that usually has its teeth bared. On its body are two pairs of wings: an upper pair that is slightly larger and a lower pair that developed from its hind legs. Both pairs have green-blue membranes, but the lower pair's membranes are only visible from the back. The upper wings have two claw-like fingers near the middle. On the bottom of its body are what appear to be a pair of stubby feet or tufts of fur.\n\nCrobat is capable of flying long distances by alternating between its two sets of wings. The extra set of wings has also improved its flight speed without sacrificing its ability to fly silently. It can also travel through cramped caves without ever slowing. The combination of silent flight and sharp fangs allows it to bite down on prey without being noticed and drain their blood. If unable to consume blood, it becomes lethargic and unable to fly. Due to its lack of legs, it is clumsy on the ground and only able to crawl around with its wings. Crobat is rarely found in the wild, though it is typically found in caves or on tree branches, where it hangs upside-down by its rear wings. It is a nocturnal Pokémon."

The tip of its tail tends to glow when it attacks or is excited.\n\nAzumarill has highly developed hearing that allows it to hear distances, even when it is underwater. By keeping still and listening closely, it can identify prey even in wild, fast-moving rivers. If Azumarill spots a drowning Pokémon, it will make an air bubble that helps them breathe or when Azurill are playing near the rivers. It lives in rivers and lakes and can live in the water all day long.\n\nPrior to Generation VI and in Generation IX, Azumarill and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Huge Power as an Ability."

Sudowoodo (Japanese: ウソッキー Usokkie) is a Rock-type Pokémon introduced in Generation II.\n\nIt evolves from Bonsly when leveled up while knowing Mimic.\n\nIn Generation II, its remakes, and Pokémon Emerald, wild Sudowoodo can be found blocking the road in inconvenient locations in Johto and Hoenn. In order to engage it in battle, a Trainer must first squirt it with water from either a SquirtBottle or Wailmer Pail.\nSudowoodo is a Pokémon that has a brown, log-shaped body with yellow spots. It has short legs with toeless feet, and thin forelegs with three green spheres at the ends of its fingers. It has a forked \"branch\" on top of its head, which is shorter on the female than on the male. Despite its appearance, Sudowoodo's composition is closer to a rock than a plant. Originally, it was incorrectly believed to be a Grass-type.\n\nSudowoodo disguises itself as a tree and stands along paths to avoid being attacked. Sudowoodo's camouflage fails in the winter, as its forelegs remain green, unlike real trees. Sudowoodo is very weak to water and hates it, so whenever it starts to rain, it will break their disguise and flee to the nearest source of shelter. Because it holds its position for so long, its arms have become supple yet strong. It is popular with the elderly, with available magazines and fans devoted to its arm angle and length. Sudowoodo can be found living in forests, sometimes sharing a habitat with Trevenant. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Sudowoodo is known to keep its tree mimicry even when sleeping. However, it will occasionally let of this stance and sleep instead on the ground.\n\nIn Generation II, Mimic was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."

Its legs are well developed and it has bulbous toes and fingers.\n\nPolitoed acts as a leader to Poliwag and Poliwhirl, which gather from afar upon hearing its cry. Politoed likes to expand its throat and sing. When three or more assemble, they sing in a chorus with a loud, bellowing voice. The curled hair on Politoed's head is considered proof of its status as a king. The longer and curlier Politoed's hair is, the more Poliwag and Poliwhirl will obey it, and the more it is respected by other Politoed. Politoed is rarely found in the wild, though it is usually seen living by the water's edge.\n\nAt nightfall, Politoed appears near lakes to make territorial claims through cries that sound like shouting. A male Politoed's cry is said to be louder than a female Politoed's cry. A male Politoed with a deep, menacing voice will become more popular with the opposite gender."

There is a circular yellow pad on the underside of each foot.\n\nHoppip's body is very light, and it is easily lifted off the ground by winds and will drift in the air. Hoppip can sense approaching strong winds. In order to avoid being blown away, it clusters and links leaves with other Hoppip or grips the ground firmly with its feet. However, it enjoys gentle breezes. Hoppip tends to be carried by the winds across vast distances, and thus can be found all over the world except in cold regions.

Skiploom spreads its petals to absorb as much sunlight as possible. The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as the temperature fluctuates and its flower blossoms when the temperature rises above 64 °F (18 °C). Because of this, it is sometimes used as a thermometer. It floats in the air to try to get closer to the sun, but closes its flower and immediately hides under the shade of a tree when it rains. If the weather gets too cold, Skiploom will fly away and migrate to warmer regions so that it can photosynthesize. Some people claim to be able to determine a Skiploom's birth location by the scent coming off of its flower. Skiploom lives in temperate grasslands. As seen in the games, the bloom on its head can turn clockwise."

Three cotton puffs, almost as large as the body itself, extend off it: one on each arm, and one on top of its head. These puffs produce cotton spores that Jumpluff can use to float in the air, and it can control its flight even in a hurricane. Three to four leaves grow at the base of the top puff.\n\nJumpluff drifts on seasonal winds and can use its spores to masterfully maneuver itself around the globe. It will spread cotton spores as it floats around to create offspring; inhaling these spores may cause coughs and itchiness. It descends if it encounters cold air currents while it is floating. Though it spends a good amount of time in the air, it is commonly sighted above open temperate grasslands. Once Jumpluff runs out of its cotton spores, its journey — and its life — reaches its end."

Unlike its feet, Aipom's arms are simple, purple stubs.\n\nAipom uses its powerful tail freely and cleverly for many purposes. The tail is strong enough to anchor Aipom to a branch and suspend the rest of its body in the air, but also delicate enough to pick fruit and manipulate objects. Aipom has been known to wrap its tail around tree branches as it sleeps so it does not fall. Since Aipom uses its tail so much, its actual arms are not as dexterous and become clumsy over time. Aipom lives high in the treetops of tropical, temperate, and even boreal forests, using its tail for balance as it swings from branch to branch. In Alola, Bounsweet is its favorite food."

Two of the stripes start jaggedly above Sunkern's dark eyes and continue downward. The other stripe is directly below Sunkern's mouth. Since Sunkern's eyelids are brown, the brown streak patterning appears uninterrupted when Sunkern's eyes are closed. Its beady eyes are black with white pupils.\n\nSunkern is known to be very weak. Aware of its weakness, it only feeds until it evolves. However, it feeds on only the dew from under the leaves of plants. It tries to move as little as possible since it tries to conserve all the nutrients it has stored in its body for evolution. If attacked by predators such as Spearow, it shakes its leaves at the attacker. Sunkern occasionally falls from the sky on early mornings for unknown reasons. A year after a cold summer, the population of Sunkern explodes. Sunkern can be found in temperate, grassy meadows."

Because of this, it tends to pursue sunlight and is always looking in the direction of the sun. While the sun is up, it moves around in a hectic manner. When the sun sets, it comes to a complete stop and closes its petals. In addition to sunlight, Sunflora needs plenty of water. The animated series demonstrates that sunlight can cause a Sunflora's head to grow. Too much sunlight exposure will grow their heads so big that it will immobilize a Sunflora. Sunflora is rarely seen in the wild, but it can sometimes be found in temperate grassy meadows."

Compared to its long, thin abdomen, its thorax is short and wide. It has three pairs of gray two-toed legs and two pairs of wings with red bands on them. The see through wings are described as frail and thin. A bright green mask marking covers most of its face, and it has two spikes on top of its head. Its blue eyes can see all around its body at 360 degrees without even moving its head. This allows Yamma to have a high evasiveness.

On its belly are dark blue curved markings.\n\nIt is implied in the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode The Sinnoh Iceberg Race! that Wooper is a dull-witted Pokémon oblivious to its surroundings. Wooper lives in cold water most of the time. When sleeping, it partially buries itself in the mud at the bottom. It will occasionally leave the water when the air cools in the evening to search for food along the shore. While walking on land, it coats its body with a slimy, toxic film that keeps its skin from dehydrating and insulates against the cold. The film causes a shooting pain if touched barehanded. It is a timid Pokémon and tends to stay close to Quagsire. Arbok is a natural predator of Wooper. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Wooper tends to bury half its body in the mud at the bottom of the water to sleep. When Wooper also does this while sleeping on land. By sleeping in the mud on land, Wooper can keep its skin wet and prevent dehydration."

Quagsire shares many similarities with its Paldean relative, Clodsire.\n\nQuagsire is carefree and sluggish by nature, although it is protective towards Wooper. An unintelligent Pokémon, it tends to bump its head inadvertently while swimming and seems not to care. It hunts for food by leaving its mouth wide open in water and waiting for its unaware prey to blunder in. Because Quagsire does not move, it does not get very hungry and can afford to wait for its food. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, Quagsire leaves its mouth open even as it sleeps. It is said seeing a Quagsire asleep with its mouth wide open is a sign it’s possbily waiting for prey, while it dreams. Quagsire lives in clean bodies of freshwater, as well as muddy swamps. During the day, Quagsire avoids sunlight by submerging itself in the water.\n\nIn the Pokémon the Series episode Once in a Blue Moon, wild Quagsire are shown to have an annual celebration at Blue Moon Falls when the moon is full. There they attempt to shoot round objects they have collected to the top of a waterfall with their attacks, to see who can launch their objects the highest, with the apparent target being the moon."

Its forehead and legs have yellow rings on them.\n\nUmbreon's evolution is the result of Eevee being exposed to the moonlight, which altered its genetic structure. Umbreon's yellow rings glow when it is excited, such as when it leaps to attack; or when exposed to the moon's aura, which fills it with a mysterious energy. Umbreon hunts at night and, as such, has well-developed eyes that can spot a prey even in darkness. Its black fur helps it blend into the night while waiting for the right moment to pounce. When it does, its rings emit a dim yet ominous glow, and it lunges for the prey's throat before eating it. Whenever angered or agitated, Umbreon sprays poisonous sweat secreted from its pores into the offender's eyes to protect itself. Umbreon primarily specializes in defensive prowess. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Umbreon is known to be difficult to find while it sleeps during the night.

It has a fondness for anything sparkly, and it will go as far as fighting with other Pokémon, such as Meowth or Gabite, in order to gain their stashes. However, it is also known to give these sparkly objects to Trainers that it is fond of. Whenever it is chased, it loses the attacker by leading it down dark mountain trails, and sometimes it does this to travelers as a mean-spirited prank. Its thieving and nocturnal nature has led it to become representative of misfortune.

It is primarily pink, with a pale yellow muzzle and scaled belly. Its feet and hands each have a single clawed digit, while the hands also have a clawless thumb. Around its neck is a spiny ruff with alternating red and white stripes. The Shellder on its head has a spiral shape with two horns near the base. A red gem resides in the center of the Shellder.

However, if the Shellder on its head comes off, it will forget everything it has learned and would revert itself back to Slowpoke. As seen in Slowking's Crowning! , Slowking's Shellder crown can take control of human who wears the crown. Slowking's intelligence can match that of a human and it constantly attempts to learn more. Its inspiration and intuition are also highly developed, and Slowking is able to stay calm in any situation and plan situations with effective results; this allows Slowking to solve anything. In the games, Slowking's speech is said to be unintelligible; however, in The Power of One, it can understand and speak the human language.\n\nAccording to The Complete Pokémon Pocket Guide, it has such an easygoing personality that it is never stressed. Slowking is rarely found in the wild, though it can be found by the water's edge. It has been seen eating seaweed and drinking coconut milk. In Alola, it is known as \"the sage of the sea\", and it occasionally matches wits with Oranguru by the beach.

Unown (Japanese: アンノーン Unknown) is a Psychic-type Pokémon introduced in Generation II.\n\nWhile it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Unown has 28 different forms. All of them are known as One form, as seen in the Pokédex.\n\nIn Generation II, there were 26 Unown forms based on Latin alphabet characters. In Generation III, two new forms were introduced as well: ? (question mark) and ! (exclamation mark). The Unown forms are chronicled in the Unown Mode, the Unown Report, and the Unown Research Notes.\n\nIn Generation II, its shape is determined by its individual values; in Generation III, it is determined by its personality value; from Generation IV onwards, it is determined by a separate form identifier.\nUnown is a flat, thin Pokémon shaped like an eye with appendages that make it resemble a letter or a punctuation mark. It is entirely black, except for its white sclerae. All 26 alphabetic forms of Unown have fully open eyes, while the two punctuation forms have half-closed eyes. Though each of its forms has a counterpart in the Latin alphabet, Unown is said to resemble ancient writing and hieroglyphs called Unown symbols. It is a mystery whether Unown predates or postdates written language, and therefore which one is based on the other. Unown can move its appendages independently like tentacles or fingers.\n\nIn the Japanese version of Pokémon Crystal, a researcher implies that the Unown began appearing at the Ruins of Alph after the Pokémon Communication Center was built in Goldenrod City. This text was translated and left unused in the English release.\n\nThe Pokédex, Unown Report, and Professor Oak's research disagree on whether Unown communicates using electromagnetic waves (specifically radio waves) or telepathy. Either way, it can be detected by the Pokégear radio, which interprets it as the melody of the Azure Flute. Unown has an unknown connection to Arceus. It is said that an \"odd power\" emerges when more than one Unown come together. Certain Unown loose in the Hisui region were capable of repelling Poké Balls that contained Pokémon, preventing them from being battled. Professor Laventon's research observed that Unown resemble human writing from other lands, though no one took him seriously. In the Pokémon movie Spell of the Unown: Entei, Unown is shown to be capable of reading the thoughts of other life forms. Great numbers of Unown are capable of distorting reality to suit the dreams and wishes of whoever is in control of the Unown. However, they can only do this when more Unown are present, so it could be a shared effort rather than an ability unique to each Unown.\n\nUnown is an extremely rare Pokémon that lives in its own dimension and rarely ventures outside. When it moves to the Pokémon world, Unown tends to stick to walls like engravings of ancient texts, or orbit other Unown, usually in ruins.\n\nIn Pokémon Crystal, the Unown are said to share a cooperative bond with Suicune.\n\nIn Generation VIII, Unown is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Hidden Power."

    "solution": "This is wobbuffet, and is a Psychic-type Pokemon. Wobbuffet (Japanese: ソーナンス Sonans) is a Psychic-type Pokémon introduced in Generation II.\n\nIt evolves from Wynaut starting at level 15.\nWobbuffet is a tall, cyan Pokémon with a soft body. Its eyes usually appear scrunched, and it has a jagged upper lip. The female Wobbuffet has a red marking on its mouth that resembles lipstick, while the male does not. It has flat arms that are wider towards the tip and four stubby legs at the base of its body. There are two eyespots on its black tail. Its eyespots are revealed to be capable of blinking and looking around using its tail in the Pokémon Stadium series. Wobbuffet is very protective of its tail, to the point where it will suddenly turn uncharacteristically aggressive if the tail is attacked.\n\nWobbuffet is usually a docile Pokémon that will never attack first. However, when it is attacked, it will inflate its body and initiate a counter-strike. When two or more of this Pokémon meet, they will attempt to outlast each other in a battle of endurance. However, since neither is able to attack, they may compete to see which can last without food. Because of its overprotective nature regarding its tail and hatred of light, Wobbuffet lives in dark caves. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Wobbuffet is known to keep its tail hidden even while it sleeps. However, it will drop its guard when deeply asleep, exposing its tail completely.\n\nPrior to Generation V, Wobbuffet and its pre-evolved form, Wynaut, were the only known Pokémon that could have Shadow Tag as an Ability."

The tail's head has yellow eyes, a mouth full of sharp teeth, and a small brain. However, this head is incapable of independent thinking and relies on outside stimuli such as smell to guide its actions. If the tail smells something alluring, it will bite. The tail often mimics the head during feeding and is able to warn the Pokémon of danger if it is sleeping.

Along its bottom jaw are ridges: there are two pairs of ridges on a male Steelix, while there is only one pair on a female. Several small, square lumps cover the underside of its lower jaw. Its eye sockets are slightly deep-set, and the eyes themselves are red. Its head has two long ridges going from the eyes up to the top of its head. The tip of its tail is conical with a blunt tip.\n\nSteelix burrows up to six-tenths of a mile underground, even further than its pre-evolved form Onix, and it can be found in mountains or caves. Steelix can dig even towards the world's core. It easily chews through boulders with its powerful jaws, and its eyes are capable of seeing in the dark. Exposure to underground heat and pressures alongside its iron-rich soil diet has made its body harder than diamonds. Steelix's evolution is said to have been the result of an Onix's composition becoming more diamond-like after living for about 100 years. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Steelix is known to sleep in a upright postion.As noted by researchers, it can maintain this superb balance without even toppling over."

Around its wrists are two black band markings, and it has a short tail.\n\nA Granbull's main weapons are its well-developed lower jaw and heavy fangs. The bite from its jaws is said to be very powerful. However, due to how heavy its jaws are, Granbull keeps its head tilted down constantly for balance. Despite its fierce appearance, it is actually very timid and sensitive, even more so than Snubbull. Granbull rarely bites as it prefers not to get involved in disputes. Unless Granbull is startled, it will not bite indiscriminately. If attacked, it will flail about to fend off its attacker. Granbull is popular with young people due to how it acts and looks.

All around its body are sharp, conical spikes, which evolved from scales over time.\n\nIn order to attack, Qwilfish drinks over 2.6 gallons (10 litres) of water to inflate its body. It then uses the water pressure to shoot poisonous quills at its foe, which can cause fainting. Qwilfish is briefly left defenseless shortly after firing its quills; this is believed by some expert fishers to be the opportune moment to catch this Pokémon. Due to its round body, Qwilfish is not a great swimmer, and when filled with water it is even harder for it to swim. When Qwilfish faces a larger opponent, it will inflate its body to match its size as close as it can. If it is startled while inflated, it will spit out all its water, propelling itself away."

It can lift and throw objects 100 times its own weight. It uses its two antennae to search for food by scent. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Heracross is known to occasionaly sleep while licking the sap it finds.The reason is due to Heracross becoming exhausted from a potentinally hard search for sweet sap.

Its claws are also used for climbing trees in boreal or sub-alpine forests where it lives. It can also bring out its claws to startle foes that attacked it.\n\nSneasel is a smart, sneaky, and notoriously vicious Pokémon, and blends well into the night in order to ambush their prey. Sneasel feeds on Eggs, such as those of Pidgey, that it steals from unattended nests. It uses its claws to poke a hole in the Egg before slurping the contents out. It has been known to form pairs to hunt: one Sneasel will lure the parents away from their nest, while the other steals their Eggs. Although the Sneasel pair works together, they will also fight over their hunt among themselves. As a result of its Egg-based diet, Sneasel are despised by Breeders to the point where they try to drive away or eradicate the former. Sneasel also preys on Alolan Sandshrew, but the Sandshrew's skin is so hard that it can cause Sneasel's claws to snap off. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Sneasel has been observed sleeping peacefully on very rare occasions despite its savage personality. Additionally, it has been seen sleeping with its belly out and languidly washing its face.\n\nPrior to Generation IV, Beat Up was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."

Swinub (Japanese: ウリムー Urimoo) is a dual-type Ice/Ground Pokémon introduced in Generation II.\n\nIt evolves into Piloswine starting at level 33, which evolves into Mamoswine when leveled up while knowing Ancient Power.\nSwinub is a small porcine Pokémon. Living in frigid temperatures, Swinub is covered in dense, brown, striped hair to keep it warm. The hair is so shaggy that it often covers its tuft-like small legs, making it appear like a legless lump. Swinub's eyes appear as if they are perpetually closed.\n\nThe only time that Swinub's eyes have been seen open was in Pokémon Adventures, during the battle between Pryce and Erika in Bringing up Bellossom, when Pryce ordered his Swinub to dodge Erika's Skiploom's attack.\n\nSwinub uses its pink, pig-like nose to dig through mud and snow, looking for anything edible. In Hisui, ancient people relied on Swinub a lot because of this skill. Occasionally, it will come across hot springs while scouring the ground. Its favorite food is a type of mushroom that grows beneath dead grass, though it also eats Berries. When a Swinub finds an attractive smell, it will run desperately to find out the source of the aroma. It inhabits cold places, such as icy caves, mountainous regions, and frozen tundra."

It also has two tusks made of ice, which seem small but can be lethal. These tusks thicken when it snows, and they are smaller on a female Piloswine than on a male. It has floppy ears that are sensitive to sound. Piloswine has two beady eyes in its head; however, these are usually covered up by tufts of fur. As it is usually unable to see, it checks surroundings with its sensitive pig-like nose instead. As a result, Piloswine is constantly charging at foes when it moves. The hairs on its back stands up straight as a warning sign for this.\n\nPiloswine's thick fur allows it to survive in harshly cold environments that it inhabits, such as icy caves, mountainous regions and frozen tundra. Its fur is so long that it usually covers its small, hooved legs. Despite the small size of its legs, its hooves ensure even footing on icy ground. Piloswine often digs for food buried beneath snow and ice using its tusks."

Galarian Corsola evolves into Cursola starting at level 38. Johtonian Corsola is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\nCorsola is a small, pink, roundish Anthozoan Pokémon with branch-like growths on its back, which are similar to coral. There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has black, oval eyes. It has a light-blue underside, which speckles towards the sides. Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby.\n\nSmaller Pokémon like Horsea and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by Corsola's branches, and even offer it protection from foes. Corsola's horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode A Corsola Caper!. Some people keep Corsola branches as charms to promote safe childbirth. Corsola's branches glitter very beautifully in seven colors when they catch sunlight. If any branch breaks off, this Pokémon grows it back in just one night.\n\nFound in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back; it is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town.\n\nIn the Alola region, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola, preying on its branches. If pursued by them, Corsola will sometimes snap its own branches off as a diversion. Conversely, Mareanie and Toxapex do not prey on Corsola in the Galar region, having not developed a taste for its branches."

However, this will not affect the Remoraid and it continues to be a separate Pokémon.\nRemoraid is a light blue piscine Pokémon with saucer-like eyes and a mouth with four pointed teeth. There are two dark stripes on its back that resembles the barrel of a revolver. It has a single pelvic fin positioned like a revolver's trigger, two small pectoral fins, and a dorsal fin near its mouth resembling a gun's front sight. In addition, it has two caudal fins, the bottom of which resembling the butt of a gun and the top resembling the hammer. All of its fins except for the dorsal fin are white. For a long period of time, due to their vast anatomical differences, no one believed that Remoraid evolved into Octillery.\n\nRemoraid is well known for its ability to shoot jets of water out of its mouth with incredible accuracy and distance. It uses its abdominal muscles to do so, often to shoot down prey, such as Burmy, out of the air. The water attack can reach its prey from over 300 feet (100 meters) away, even when the prey is moving or flying. Because of this, Remoraid is referred to as the \"sniper of the seas.\" When threatened, it can also shoot water to propel itself backward.\n\nRemoraid tends to travel by attaching to Mantine's fins or in large groups of its own kind. It attaches itself by using its dorsal fin, which acts like a suction pad. When attached to a Mantine, it feeds on whatever the Mantine leaves behind, but will fight alongside it as well. A school of Remoraid is often seen working together and traveling with a Mantyke, helping it achieve its evolution into Mantine. Remoraid is a sea-dwelling Pokémon, travelling downstream from rivers especially when evolution draws near."

There are yellow bumps on its rock-hard head and yellow suction cups on each of its eight tentacles. These suction cups and yellow bumps are smaller on a female Octillery. It uses its tentacles for manipulating objects and the suction cups give it strong gripping power. Because of this, it is very hard for it to be blown away.\n\nOctillery is a relaxed Pokémon who loves fuss from its Trainer. Even though it is more docile when domesticated, it can be very stubborn at times in the wild. It instinctively sneaks into rocky holes or pots, and if it gets sleepy, it steals the nest of a fellow Octillery. When threatened, it will spurt ink from its mouth to cover itself before escaping, allowing it to protect itself and its young from danger. Octillery's ink obscures vision and contains substances that dull predators' sense of smell. Octillery also uses this ink on its prey, before its suction cups hold the prey tightly. Its ink can also be used as a cooking ingredient. Besides ink, Octillery sometimes uses its rock-hard head on its foes. Prior to Generation VIII, Octazooka was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding.\n\nOctillery is normally found in oceans and caves. For a long time, people refused to believe Octillery was an evolution of Remoraid, because of the extreme physical differences between the two. It is thought to be a distant relative to Omastar. In New Pokémon Snap, an Octillery can be seen about to be preyed on by a Seviper."

There is a single white spot on its stomach. Its feet have two digits each.\n\nDelibird is omnivorous. It carries food bundled up in its tail. It normally gives stored food to its chicks, but has been known to share its food with humans stranded on icy mountains. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Delibird is known to sleep while occasionally reaching inside its tail to pull something out. Prior to Generation IX, Delibird was the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Present by leveling up. Present allows it to carry special items in its tail that may cause damage or heal its opponent. In a flock, the Delibird with the largest tail is its leader. Delibird tends to live in mountainous regions, making its nests over sharp cliffs; notably around Mt. Everest. Iron Bundle shares a resemblance to Delibird and is believed to be a Delibird-based machine built by an ancient civilization.\n\nDelibird and its Paradox Pokémon counterpart, Iron Bundle are the only Pokémon capable of learning the move Present."

It can breach out of the water and fly 300 feet (100 meters) into the air if it builds up enough speed. In the past, it was often misidentified as a bird Pokémon by observers who saw this behavior. Mantine is sometimes seen with a Remoraid attached to the underside of one of its fins, scavenging for its leftovers and fighting together with it when attacked. Mantine has a docile nature, and does not mind the Remoraid clinging onto its fin.\n\nIn Alola, many surfers ride waves and travel between islands on the backs of Mantine.

There are red feathers under the sheaths that cover its sharp wings, and each feather can be moved independently. Its wings are actually hollow, allowing it to travel up to 185 mph (300 km/h). Its feet have three toes on them, two in front and one in back, and its tail has hooked ends.\n\nIts steel wings become tattered and bashed in from repeated battles, but once a year the battered wings grow back completely. This process restores the cutting edges of its feathers, which are sharp enough to be used as blades and sharper than any man-made sword. Its skin and feathers are solid due to being raised in very harsh conditions. Its nests are usually found in thorn bushes, where continual scratching of a young individual's skin will eventually harden it into an iron-like state. However, water can cause Skarmory's hard body to rust easily, so it stays in its nest on rainy days. In ancient regions where these Pokémon are common, warriors would use the sharp feathers that fell off Skarmory as swords. It is a popular Pokémon that is used for heraldic designs, and in Galar, it has violent territorial clashes with Corviknight. In Blueberry Academy, Skarmory is used for the school's Flying Taxi service.\n\nIn Generation V, Steel Wing was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."

This gives Houndoom's fire a foul odor and the burns it inflicts will never heal. After finishing off its prey, Houndoom divides it evenly among its pack. Houndoom appears near rough terrain areas. Its howling induces shivering in other Pokémon, and often sends them scurrying back to their nests. In the past, people thought Houndoom's howl came from the grim reaper.

Its head is round and brown with flat, curved extensions on either side and a single spike on top. The spike horn is made from the same substance that creates both its fur and claws. The horn is continuously growing through Hitmontop's lifetime. It has beady, black eyes and spherical hands with no digits. Hitmontop is a male-only species with no female counterpart.\n\nHitmontop is very adept at fighting with dance-like kicks. This technique has an amazing combination of both offense and defense at the same time. Hitmontop moves more quickly by spinning on the spike on its head than it does by walking normally. Capable of spinning at high speeds, it may bore into the ground similar to a drill. While spinning, Hitmontop delivers smooth, graceful kicks. The centrifugal force of Hitmontop's spins boosts the destructive power of its attacks by a factor of 10. Anyone enchanted by its kicks will often get drilled hard by Hitmontop's kicks. Hitmontop often competes with Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan. As an urban species, it is often found in towns and cities.\n\nPrior to Generation VII and in Generation IX, Hitmontop is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Triple Kick. Additionally, prior to Generation VII, Hitmontop and its evolutionary relative, Hitmonlee, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Rolling Kick."

Ludicolo has black eyes surrounded by a patch of green and an orange bill. Its body is covered with shaggy yellow fur and has several zigzagging brown stripes. The female has thinner stripes than the male. Ludicolo has large green hands with two black lines on its palms, and thick green legs with a black circle on the underside of its feet.\n\nLudicolo becomes more powerful when it hears festive music and will appear near laughing children on hikes. The reason is due to structures in Ludicolo's body that can produce energy when hit by sound waves with a cheerful rhythm. As it becomes more energetic and active, it will break into a dance. This allows Ludicolo to face enemies without fear. Being the result of evolution via Evolution stone, Ludicolo is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found near the water's edge.\n\nPrior to Generation V, Ludicolo and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokémon that could have Rain Dish as an Ability."

A beige, mask-like pattern covers its large black eyes, and it has two beige feet. It has a gray \"cap\" with a short stem on top of its head. The stem is used to hang from tree branches in its forest home. While hanging, this Pokémon absorbs moisture and nutrients from the tree until it becomes too heavy and falls to the ground. The more it drinks, the glossier its body becomes. Additionally, Seedot polishes itself with leaves once daily. If it remains still, it can be mistaken for a nut and startles others by moving suddenly. It also uses this strategy to be taken by bird Pokémon to expand on its habitat."

Whismur's murmurs are barely audible, but when it senses danger, it lets out an ear-splitting cry as loud as a jet plane taking off. The cry of a Whismur is about 100 decibels and can cause an all-day headache should anyone be near it. Startled by its own cries, it will cry louder. When it finally stops crying, it will fall asleep from exhaustion. Because it breathes through its ear canals, it can cry continually. However, it will stop crying if its ear covers are shut. Whismur lives in caves."

Its eyes, covered by dark, somewhat mask-like markings, have the appearance of being closed.\n\nNosepass cannot go near others, since it would repel them with its magnetic nose. Its magnetism is stronger in cold seasons. To protect itself when in danger, it raises its magnetism and draws iron objects to its body. This technique is also used to capture prey, though it can pull natural enemies close too. Because it always points north, Nosepass has historically been used as a compass for travelers. Nosepass only moves a little over 3/8 of an inch each year, but can quickly spin its body into the ground like a drill during emergency situations. It lives in caves.

Its horns, which it uses to dig through bedrock when seeking food, grow a little longer at a time and can be used to determine its age.

However, it is unable to swim long distances. It is feared and known by many names as Bully of the Sea, Ruffian of the Seas, Bandit of the Sea, or Gangster of the Sea as a group, due to its sharp teeth. Sharpedo uses the teeth to finish off its opponent. It was once prized for its dorsal fin as a food item and has been a victim of overfishing. Its fangs can rip through iron and steel, being able to tear apart a supertanker into pieces. Sharpedo's fangs can instantly grow back the moment it comes off.

It swims with its mouth open and eats tons of food a day, such as Wishiwashi. It lives in the sea, and can only live on land for a short amount of time. It occasionally bounces onto the beaches to play. On rare occasions, pods can be seen washed up on shore — a result of genetic memories of having once lived on land.

Whiscash can predict when natural earthquakes will occur. It also uses these massive earthquakes to drive away any foes that come near it, going on rampages in the process. This behavior, along with sightings of Whiscash's leaping from lakes, has caused people to mistaken it for starting earthquakes. It lives in a nest at the bottom of ponds and swamps, and is territorial over them. Whiscash tends to wait silently for prey to come to it. This gluttonous fish will eat anything that is alive, sometimes whole, and was shown in the Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Whiscash and Ash to eat inanimate objects as well. Whiscash also has a diet of consuming mud. Whiscash has poor eyesight, so it has to use its whiskers to detect a prey's vibration."

Its feet have toenails the same color as its fruit.\n\nIn warm areas, there are ranches that raise Tropius. In Alola, its fruit is especially sweet compared to those of other regions. It lives in tropical jungles. In the TCG, Tropius was shown existing before the time Fossil Pokémon went extinct."

It has a ruff around its neck and chest and a tuft on the top of its head adorned with a single blue-black oval. Between the dark fur, the curvature of the white fur on its head, and the positioning of its horn, Absol's face vaguely resembles a wu wei symbol. It has a humanoid face with almond-shaped, red eyes, a scythe-like tail, and a scythe-shaped horn on the side of its head. Its broad feet are equipped with three claws each, and dewclaw-like spikes protrude from the heels of its hind legs and the elbows of its front legs. It walks with a pacing gait like that of a bear.\n\nAbsol lives in the mountains far from civilization, and it rarely ventures down from its alpine home. Using its horn, Absol is able to sense even subtle changes in the sky and the land to predict when a disaster will occur and will try to warn people when one is approaching. Absol is also known to protect fields from natural disasters as well. This often has the unfortunate effect of Absol itself being blamed for the disaster, notably by the elderly. The hatred for Absol was started years ago by superstitions surrounding about it. Despite this, others are interested in its ability to predict disaster. Absol has been referred to as a bringer of doom. Absol can move as swiftly as the wind. Absol is said to have a lifespan of up to 100 years. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, the powers of Absol's horn remains active even when it sleeps. Due to this, Absol can strongly detect danger even when not awake."

It will test its endurance by squeezing up against other Wynaut at night. In doing so, it strengthens itself, toughens its spirit, and learns to launch powerful counterattacks. When angered, it will slap the ground with its tail. As it loves to eat sweet fruit, it is also drawn to fruit gardens. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Wynaut maintains its smile even while sleeping. Slapping the ground with its black tail is a possible sign that Wynaut is feeling restless and angry in it sleep.\n\nPrior to Generation V, Wynaut and its evolved form, Wobbuffet, were the only known Pokémon that could have Shadow Tag as an Ability."

The coat is rimmed with an orange stripe and has three orange diamond markings on the back. As its evolved form Glalie has a body of rock, Snorunt may also be made of rock. In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, defeating a Snorunt, Glalie, or Froslass will yield some \"Snorunt fur\", suggesting the cloak is made of fur.\n\nWell-adapted to life in colder climates, it subsists on snow and ice and can survive temperatures as low as −150 degrees Fahrenheit. Snorunt is also a social creature, living and traveling with other Snorunt in groups of five. The group can live together in harmony while residing underneath giant leaves. It can be found in caves, particularly when the outside lacks snow or areas with heavy snowfall. Despite this, the Snorunt population in Alola shows it can survive in some places with warm weather. Additionally, it has been known to visit human dwellings. There is a legend that any home a Snorunt visits and lives near will prosper for generations. There is a tradition where houses would leave a lump of ice made from pure water for Snorunt to have when visiting.

Glalie's icy body is actually rock that is not particularly hard. When covered in ice, its body becomes harder than steel. It does not melt, and it can control ice by instantly freezing moisture in the air into any desirable shape. This ability is used to drape itself in ice armor and freeze its prey, which it then consumes whole. It prefers consuming Pokémon that are already frozen, such as Vanillite. It can be found in caves, particularly when the outside weather lacks snow.\n\nIn the animated series, Glalie is depicted floating in midair and moving freely, similar to flying, and can even be ridden as a form of transport."

Its stubby flippers and its underside are both beige.\n\nWhen it is happy or cheerful, such as when eating in a group, this Pokémon will clap its fins. The mealtimes of Spheal have been described as noisy as a result. Because its body is poorly shaped for swimming and can only walk slowly, it moves primarily by rolling across ice floes. This Pokémon lives in and around the sea. Spheal also lives on any drift ice that comes near the shore in order to avoid predators. Spheal are often juggled by its evolved form Sealeo, which does so to check the former's health. When a Spheal finds prey while drifting at sea, it will inform the Walrein leader of its herd on where to find the prey. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Spheal has been seen clapping its fins merrily while asleep on its back. It has led to those being curious about what happy things Spheal is dreaming about once it awakens.\n\nPrior to Generation VI, Ice Ball was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."

It has short, stubby legs and comparatively longer arms. There are flaps on the underside of its arms, which give the impression of long sleeves. On its belly is a curved seam, which conceals a third, yellow eye with a cyan pupil, known as its \"true eye\". Additionally, Jirachi has a normal pair of ovalish eyes on its face, with small, blue triangular markings underneath. On its head is a large, yellow structure with three points extending outward: one from the top and one on either side. On each point is a teal tag, known as a \"wish tag\". A rounded extension hangs from either side of the yellow structure, framing Jirachi's face. Two yellow streamers flow from Jirachi's back, resembling comet tails.\n\nJirachi hibernates for most of its life, awakening for seven days every thousand years. It can be also awakened if sung to by a voice of purity. While it sleeps, a tough, crystalline shell envelops its body to protect it from enemies. However, it is still capable of fighting while asleep when its shell is not enough to protect it, as seen in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon. During the short periods when it is awake, Jirachi is said to grant wishes. However, in the movie Jirachi: Wish Maker, Jirachi cannot create an object that is desired from a wish. Instead, it teleports the desired object to the person that made the wish. By contrast, in the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Searching for a Wish!, it displays the ability to grant wishes without the use of teleportation. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Jirachi will only grant wishes when its true eye is opened. Additionally, it can only grant three wishes every thousand years, which are written on each of its three wish tags. In this canon, Jirachi is shown being able to create artificial Pokémon through its wishes, animating a mass of seawater in the shape of a Kyogre. Jirachi's power is similarly exploited in the movie to create a monstrous Groudon. The movie further reveals that Jirachi's awakening is linked to the appearance of the Millennium Comet and that its third eye has the ability to absorb the energy Jirachi needs for hibernation. It is said that Jirachi's ability to grant wishes also gives it great attack power, as seen when it creates a concentrated bundle of light to blast its target. Although it is extremely rare, Jirachi can be found in the mountains.\n\nJirachi is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Doom Desire."

The wings are primarily tan with an orange, oval marking on each. The tips of the wings split into small, orange squares; there are three on the larger pair and two on the smaller pair. Mothim spreads steel-colored scales whenever it flaps its wings. Mothim's head has orange semi-circular eyes with gray, orange-tipped antennae running along the edges before extending and widening at the top. Its body is black with a patch of orange on the underside and a gray stripe down its back. It also has four gray legs and a small black tail that splits into two squares.\n\nMothim is a nomadic, nocturnal Pokémon that always remains on the move, searching for flower honey and nectar. It has often been seen traveling in fields and mountains. Despite its diet, Mothim is never seen near any flower gardens. This is because, instead of gathering honey on its own, Mothim raids the hives of Combee for honey. It is a male-only species, with Wormadam as its female counterpart."

Combee (Japanese: ミツハニー Mitsuhoney) is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation IV.\n\nFemale Combee evolve into Vespiquen starting at level 21. Male Combee are not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\nCombee is a small, flying, insectoid Pokémon. Its body consists of three orange, hexagonal sections that resemble honeycomb cells, arranged with two hexagons on top and the remaining hexagon between and below them. Each hexagon has a round, yellow face with two black, oval eyes and a black, curved mouth. In the middle of their foreheads, the upper two faces each have a single whisker-thin, black antenna with black, oval tips approximately the size of their eyes. They also each have a translucent, rounded-triangle-shaped wing connected to an orange, domed joint on their sides. The backsides of the upper faces are yellow and rounded, as the sides of a sphere. The bottom face is the main thinker of the three, and it is also the only one to have a full, insectoid abdomen. This abdomen is yellow near the tip with a thick, black stripe close to its hexagonal frame. Female Combee have red, wedge-shaped spots on the foreheads of their lower faces, just below the point where all three faces meet; male Combee have no distinct markings in this area.\n\nSimilar to other Pokémon with multiple heads, such as Dugtrio and Dodrio, Combee's trio of faces each have their own consciousness. For example, each face has a different taste in nectar, and Combee can fly only when the top two faces coordinate the flapping of their wings. Each Combee's trio of faces has been together since birth.\n\nUnlike bees in real life, the vast majority of Combee are male. However, Combee are otherwise similar to bees in their social behavior. They are mostly sociable among their own kind, and form groups of about a hundred individuals. They are generally harmless to others, as they tend to flee when threatened. From sunrise to sunset, Combee will collect nectar to create Honey wherever they can. Beautifly often provides trouble by driving away any Combee that tries to collect near it. Though Combee produce Honey for multiple purposes, they usually consume it. Each swarm of Combee makes a different flavor of honey. When not gathering nectar, Combee will protect their queen Vespiquen. They are very suggestible and will never defy the orders of their queen. When a Vespiquen feels threatened, its Combee will not think twice about risking their lives to protect their queen, to the point of aggressively attacking or even killing the threat. Combee commonly live in caves and hollow trees of forests and other natural, secluded areas with their queen. Combee sleep by creating a hive with other Combee, locking together into a tessellated wall to feel safe in larger numbers. Teddiursa and Mothim regularly raid Combee nests for the Honey they collected.\n\nPrior to Generation V, Honey Gather was Combee's signature Ability."

Vespiquen (Japanese: ビークイン Beequen) is a dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation IV.\n\nIt evolves from a female Combee starting at level 21. Male Combee are not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\nVespiquen is a bee-like Pokémon with a typical insect-like, three-part body, i.e. divided into an abdomen, thorax, and head. It has a yellow- and black-striped abdomen, which flares out from a thin, waist-like protrusion under its thorax in a manner that resembles an elegant ballgown. Underneath the expansive abdomen are seven orange, honeycomb-like cells that serve as a nest for baby Combee; the centermost cell, however, surrounds what appears to be a slender, yellow, more insect-like abdomen, which is often obscured by the ‘gown’ part of its abdomen. Vespiquen has black arms that each consist of two thin, conical segments. Each arm ends in two small, orange claws. It flies with a pair of relatively small wings, each of which consists of two stacked, translucent teardrop segments. Vespiquen's arms and wings attach to its round thorax, which is yellow on the front, black on the back, and orange on each side where its arms attach. A curved line on its back, between its orange shoulders, separates its thorax and waist. Vespiquen's head consists of its face and horns. Its orange face has intimidating red eyes; yellow mandibles that protrude from its face and connect to its horns; and a large, red gem on its forehead. Vespiquen's horns are yellow near its face and black at the tips, and with the gem, they resemble historical headpieces or crowns worn by European royal and noble women in the Late Middle Ages, such as the escoffion.\n\nSimilar to queen bees in real life, Vespiquen is a female-only species. Vespiquen is the sole queen of a hive of Combee, which it commands by releasing pheromones. The more pheromones Vespiquen produces, the more Combee it will have in its hive. As queen, Vespiquen gives birth to and raises Combee grubs, feeding on flowers to make honey for its progeny; it also controls and protects its hive. It is far more powerful than its Combee, and it will only take direct action if its Combee are unable to protect the hive; even so, the Combee will defend their Vespiquen even to the point of death. Vespiquen will destroy and feed on any outsiders it catches sneaking into its hive. However, if outsiders prove themselves to a Vespiquen by defending its hive, it may repay these acts of kindness with a reward.\n\nVespiquen is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Attack Order, Defend Order, and Heal Order."

A female Pachirisu's blue stripe is shorter than a male's. A large white tooth grows out of its mouth. It has deep gray eyes and a yellow circle on each cheek. Its tail is almost twice as big as its body, with three spikes at the top of the curl, which it can use to shoot charges. Though its arms and legs are very short, it can run incredibly fast, enabling it to tire pursuing Pokémon out quickly. It has a great amount of electricity flowing within its body. If it builds up enough charge, it may shock other Pokémon. It is related to the Pikachu line.\n\nWhen it sleeps, Pachirisu likes to curl its big, fluffy tail round to the front of its body and uses it as a pillow. It also likes to chase and groom its tail. When a Pachirisu sheds its fur it shapes them into furballs, which have static charges just like its fur. It hides its favorite foods—which mainly consist of berries—in these static puffs and stores them in tree holes. It does this to protect the food; if a human or another Pokémon tries to take the food, they will get shocked from the static. It may rub cheek pouches with another Pachirisu to share stored electricity. It is generally found in treetops in forests, as well as the outskirts of a forest and near power plants."

The flotation sac goes in a kind of ring behind its head, down in front of its arms, then back behind its rear above the tails. Floatzel's sac developed as a result of chasing prey in the water. To help it dive, Floatzel can deflate its flotation sac, and then inflate it once again when it wishes to surface. Floatzel's sac allows it to not drown, even in stormy seas. Along with hunting for food, Floatzel can use its swimming capabilities to assist in the rescues of drowning people, by carrying them like a raft. It is often seen near fishing hamlets."

    "solution": "This is shellos, and is a Water-type Pokemon. Shellos (Japanese: カラナクシ Karanakushi) is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV.\n\nIt evolves into Gastrodon starting at level 30.\n\nShellos has two different forms: West Sea Shellos, which is pink and white in appearance, and East Sea Shellos, which is blue and green. They are found on the respective sides of Sinnoh's mountain range.\nShellos is a sea slug-like Pokémon whose appearance changes depending on which part of the sea it is found in. Both forms have amorphous, slug-like bodies, black oval-shaped eyes with yellow outlines, minuscule, dot-shaped noses, and wide yellow lips. Like real-world sea slugs, they have mantles covering the top halves of their bodies. These mantles are outlined in yellow, similar to their eyes. Unlike real sea slugs, however, they have bulbous heads and four small feet rather than one large foot.\n\nThe West Sea form's underside is white, and its mantle is pink, with several small spike-like protrusions on its back. On its head is a ring of pink, fleshy knobs resembling the gills of a nudibranch. West Sea Shellos' appearance is theorized to have been influenced by warm ocean waters.\n\nThe East Sea form, meanwhile, sports a green underside and a turquoise mantle. Two yellow-lined, flap-like protrusions, resembling cerata, are present along its back. On its head are two white-tipped tentacles resembling rhinophores that extend away from its face. East Sea Shellos's appearance is theorized to have been influenced by cold ocean waters.\n\nShellos lives along seashores; its color becomes more vibrant the better quality of the waters it lives in. It is also believed that Shellos's diet, which consists of plankton, also influences its form, though this has yet to be proven. The physical differences between both forms appear largely cosmetic; no significant changes in capabilities have been observed. While it can travel onto land, it can only stay on the shore for a limited time before its skin dries out. When Shellos' squishy body is pressed or squeezed, or when Shellos senses imminent danger, a mysterious purple fluid — theorized to be a kind of stress-induced greasy sweat — will ooze out of its body. This fluid is its defense mechanism against enemies; although harmless, it is very sticky and hard to wash off. Shellos has a friendly disposition and is said to have great regenerative capabilities. In the animated series, West Sea Shellos can extend their necks to incredible lengths. It is unknown if the East Sea form can do this as well.\n\nThis species once had a shell on its back long ago and is considered a close relative to Pokémon such as Shellder. The Nurse Joy featured in Gateway to Ruin! revealed Mount Coronet's formation led to an allopatric speciation event, in which the original population of Shellos was separated into two. As a result, Shellos's color and other physical aspects began to vary due to environmental differences and population isolation over time. The two forms are still able to interbreed; the child normally takes the mother's form but takes the father's if bred with a Ditto. Recently, East Sea Shellos' population has been declining, while West Sea Shellos has become more abundant than before."

Much like its pre-evolved form, it has a slug-like body with a round head and a mantle covering the top half of its body. It has six stubby legs and two black eyes with white pupils, with a mark imitating a third eye appearing on its forehead. A yellow stripe runs along the edge of its mantle, through its two lower eyes, and around the back of its head. Like Shellos, Gastrodon has two forms based on the sea it lives in.\n\nIn its West Sea form, it has a pair of large tentacles on its head that curve upward and a smaller, straighter pair on its neck. Its underside is pink, while its mantle is brown, with three pink spots on each side of its back. There are also two lumps on its back, resembling the cerata on real-life sea slugs.\n\nIn its East Sea form, it retains the head tentacles it had as a Shellos, which are now fully green and angled slightly further upward. Its underside is turquoise, while its mantle is forest green with two turquoise spots on each side. It has a pair of yellow, fin-like cerata on its back and a wavy yellow line bordering its side and rear.\n\nGastrodon and its pre-Evolution Shellos are examples of allopatric speciation, although the two forms can still breed with each other. It is also a relative of Shellder and Cloyster. When threatened, it oozes a purple liquid and flees. While not poisonous, the fluid is very bitter and sticky. Its mucus-coated body is soft and squishy yet surprisingly resilient, and it leaves behind a trail of sticky slime when moving on land. It also has strong regenerative capabilities that allow it to recover from injuries or dismemberment within a few hours. In ancient times, it had a shell on its back, which gradually became a thin yet hard vestigial plate.\n\nGastrodon lives in shallow tidal pools, beaches, and rocky shorelines. Its diet consists mainly of plankton, but it is occasionally known to move onto land to look for other foods, such as beach sand. When it finds prey, it melts it with mucus before eating them. While Gastrodon cannot stay out of water for too long due to its body being highly vulnerable to dehydration, it becomes more active during cloudy or rainy weather. It has been found on far-off mountains during times of constant rain. The two forms of Gastrodon are known to engage in heated conflict with one another. West Sea Gastrodon was much more numerous in the past than it is in the present. Conversely, East Sea Gastrodon's population has visibly increased in population as of late."

Mismagius (Japanese: ムウマージ Mumargi) is a Ghost-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV.\n\nIt evolves from Misdreavus when exposed to a Dusk Stone.\nMismagius is a purple, ghost-like Pokémon. It has a round head with elaborate tufts resembling a witch's hat atop it. The tips of the tufts are paler than most of the body. It has a thin, red mouth that resembles the letter \"W.\" Below its head, Mismagius has a short, thorax-like lump from which its body connects. Three elliptical red spheres surround the upper portion of Mismagius's body. There are extensions on the sides of its lower body with the foremost ones tattered compared to rear ones. This gives Mismagius the appearance of wearing some kind of cloak.\n\nMismagius usually shows up without warning to cause havoc on unsuspecting humans or Pokémon. If it is powerful, Mismagius can use advanced incantations for various purposes, such as causing misery or happiness. Due to this, people often seek to capture Mismagius as if their life depends on it, solely to make someone fall in love with them. There is a custom on inviting Mismagius to one's home, usually to ward off misfortune with its spells. However, this can also lead to disaster should Mismagius ever be provoked. People that hear its cries will usually receive headaches and hallucinations. As shown in the Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl episode Malice In Wonderland!, Mismagius can put its victims to sleep, and cause them to enter a strange dream world without their noticing. If Mismagius falls asleep or is knocked out, the victim will wake up. It can sometimes be found roaming around lakes and mountainsides at night."

With a mere cry, it can summon and organize a murder of more than one hundred Murkrow to collect food for it. Honchkrow also summons Murkrow to fight on its behalf, letting them do most of the fighting before it deals the finishing blow. The flocks of summoned Murkrow often plunge the sky into pitch-black darkness, giving Honchkrow the moniker, \"Summoner of Night.\" Honchkrow will never forgive any failure or betrayal of the Murkrow that follow it, and it will hunt and punish any member of its flock that does so. Honchkrow is more active at night, and normally spends the daytime hours tending to its feathers in solitude. It is a scavenger that lives in swamps, forests, human towns and cities, and plains."

It barges into the nests of other Pokémon and frightens them off so Purugly can claim the nest as its own. It does this by glaring with its eyes ceaselessly. It can be found in both urban areas and heavily wooded forests. Despite its disrespectful and scary nature, Purugly is rather popular. The reason is due to its beautiful fur, more comfortable than even velveteen."

Its massive tail, which has a cream-colored stripe, sits on top of its back and head.\n\nSkuntank is known for its noxious fluid which smells dreadful. It can spray this fluid over 160 feet (50 meters), and the longer it allows the liquid to ferment within its belly, the more powerful the smell. Unlike its pre-Evolution and real-life skunks, which spray fluids from their rears, Skuntank sprays its fluid from its tail tip, which can open. The stench of Skuntank's fluid varies depending on its diet. Skuntank prefers to nest in large, prickly bushes in heavily wooded areas and digs holes in the ground to make its nest. While Skuntank can use its poisonous fluids to take down prey, ironically it cannot handle the smell of its own stench, abandoning potential defeated meals as a result."

As its green spheres dry out, their dull luster increases. It can remain in the same spot for a long time. It also has a habit of crying, not because it is sad or needing attention, but rather it is due to excess moisture in its body. As it cries, it expels both sweat and tears from its eyes; Bonsly's sweat tastes a little salty, while the tears are slightly bitter. It dies if it gets too damp with this moisture. This habit also gets enemies to let their guards down. It prefers dry, rock-strewn areas, but it is not uncommon to see one in a garden. As suggested by Brock's Bonsly, a very young Bonsly needs to be bottle-fed but can eat solid food when it matures. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, people tend to think Bonsly is crying in its sleep, and that something is wrong. However, it is merely expelling water from its body to adjust its body's fluid levels."

On top of its head is a curly outgrowth that resembles a ponytail, with a dark pink band around the base. The appearance of this curly growth of hair often annoys Happiny. It has three round bumps on its forehead and two pink circles on its cheeks. There is a pouch around the lower half of its body. The pouch is red with a white stripe around the top.\n\nHappiny's pouch is rubbery and flexible, enabling the Happiny to put things into it with ease. As it cannot produce Eggs yet, it makes up for it by carrying something round and white in its pouch to imitate Chansey and Blissey, typically an Egg-shaped stone. Happiny highly treasures this stone. It may give this stone to people whom it likes, however, it can throw a tantrum and cry should the stone be taken from it or not returned to it.

Although lacking a physical body, Spiritomb projects its appearance out of a small rock called the Odd Keystone. The rock is trapezoidal in shape and has two small dots. There is a fissure running down the middle, splitting in two near the bottom. The crack in combination with the two dots appears to form a frowning face. Spiritomb's projected appearance is an ethereal composition of swirling purple energy of an unknown kind. Its face is set in the middle of the purple, and contains green, crescent eyes that are connected to its jagged mouth. Its pupils are composed of a spiral and it is sometimes only seen with one. Swirling around its face are green orbs with yellow centers.\n\nSpiritomb is formed by a collection of 108 spirits, some of which are ill-natured. This collection of spirits is known for its misdeeds; thus, as punishment, the spirits were trapped to its Odd Keystone by a traveler using a mysterious spell. Several Pokédex entries state that Spiritomb was sealed roughly 500 years before the present time. The Pokémon lays curses with its wicked thoughts. It will lash out at anyone with little thought, often exercising short-sightedness in its pursuit of vengeance. It is rarely encountered in the wild. In most media, Spiritomb moves its body primarily through levitation; though in the core series games, it can only appear to do so through dragging the Odd Keystone across the ground.\n\nPapers found within Sea Mauville in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire state that it was donated from the Oreburgh Mine, suggesting that several Odd Keystones meant to contain Spiritomb can be found in the Underground of Sinnoh. Professor Cozmo's father, Raizoh, was responsible for misplacing it when working on the ship.\n\nIn Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Spiritomb's 108 spirits appear in the form of Wisps, small purple entities scattered across the Hisui region after a seal was broken. When 107 Wisps have been taken to a large Odd Keystone shrine at the Crimson Mirelands' Shrouded Ruins as per Vessa's request, she will provide the player with the final Wisp and disappear, with a wild Spiritomb appearing shortly afterwards.\n\nAs depicted in The Keystone Pops!, Spiritomb can be just as aggressive and destructive as the spirits that it is composed of. The Spectral Express! also revealed that anyone possessed by one of Spiritomb's spirits will start to cause misdeeds, and their face will eventually start to resemble Spiritomb. Losing one of these spirits will cause Spiritomb to go on an uncontrollable rampage until the lost spirit is returned."

It is sensitive to a special type of energy called Aura; however, it does not have the ability to fully use these powers, although it can still emanate these waves to communicate and sense them, albeit only in ripples. It has developed two black appendages that hang down from its head, which rise when Riolu reads or manipulates aura. It has even been seen that Riolu can sense and react to Aura before they even hatch. The aura emitting from Riolu's body grows even stronger when it is frightened or sad.\n\nLike most Fighting-type Pokémon, Riolu naturally has superhuman strength, stamina, and endurance. It is capable of making long journeys on foot in a short amount of time. It is a playful, energetic, and loyal Pokémon. It is also known to be tough and hard working. Riolu will read the minds of humans to assure whether or not they are pure of heart. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Riolu tends to sleep in an unusual position. This position is sitting up while not lying down, similar to Lucario. It is believed that Riolu is pushing itself hard and dreaming of the day it evolves into Lucario."

With sufficient training, a Lucario can read auras to understand how living beings are feeling from more than half a mile (1 kilometer) away. However, it sometimes ends up learning information that it would not like to know, causing it to get stressed out easily. It also has the power to manipulate this energy in an offensive manner, in the form of explosive spheres of energy. Lucario can understand human speech and has been reported to communicate with humans through telepathy.\n\nLucario is considered to be prideful and is extremely loyal to its Trainer. It also seems to have a natural sense of justice, as it only trusts Trainers with righteous hearts. It is an exceptionally rare Pokémon that usually lives deep in mountains very far from people to improve their skills. Lucario are primarily carnivores, hunting their prey in packs, though one Lucario was seen eating Berries and plants like roses. It has also been seen eating chocolate, even though chocolate is not part of its natural diet. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Lucario never lowers its guard, even when sleeping. It is believed Lucario's reading the aura of others similar to when it's awake."

This leads some people to believe that Magnezone came from outer space and that it is being controlled by unknown beings. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Magnezone's screws and magnets will spin while it sleeps.

These fingers are completely red on a female Tangrowth, while they have red tips on a male.\n\nTangrowth is unfazed if one of its arms is broken off, as it will easily grow back. It hunts by disguising itself as a shrub, then grabbing prey with its vines. However, Tangrowth has been known to eat fruit as well. It can extend its arms as much as it wants. Predators like to eat Tangrowth's vines. When the climate is warm, its vine growth is accelerated to the point where not even its eyes can be seen. If its vines grow too long, Tangrowth shortens them by tearing bits of them off. Tangrowth is very rare in the wild, though it can be found in temperate grasslands."

Academics can't seem to agree on whether Porygon-Z should be considered a true evolution of Porygon2. In ancient Hisui, people were confused about Porygon-Z and its evolutionary relatives due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time.\n\nPorygon-Z and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Conversion and Conversion 2.

Mesprit is said to have taught humans the ability to feel sorrow, pain, and joy. It was shown in The Needs of the Three! and The Battle Finale of Legend! that it can teleport itself, as well as other Pokémon and humans. Though playful, it is a bit mischievous. In the past, it has been referred to as the \"Being of Emotion\" due to its role in giving humans the ability to feel happiness and sadness present in life. Alongside the other lake guardians, Mesprit is needed for the creation of a Red Chain. Either through gems extracted from its body or through its plume. Together they're also capable of destroying a Red Chain. They even have the power to calm down Dialga and Palkia should the deities be enraged, but not both at once. Mesprit lives in Lake Verity, specifically in the Verity Cavern at the center of the lake, thus gaining the title Lake Guardian. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Mesprit is shown to be capable of speaking the human language via telepathy.\n\n.\n\nMesprit and the other lake guardians are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Mystical Power."

It can also travel through time to visit the past, present, and future. Additionally, it is capable of blasting its targets with power that distorts time itself. It also has the power to destroy and create an entire universe, either by itself or with Palkia's aid. As shown in Pokémon Journeys: The Series, Dialga's temporal powers possess the ability to devolve anything or anyone against their will, including Pokémon, people, and plant life. It can reverse these effects as well. It is said that time started moving when Dialga was born and will continue flowing as long as its heart beats. Dialga usually travels by levitating. Since Dialga primarily resides in a different dimension, its behavior is nearly impossible to study. In the dimension where Dialga lives in, time is said to be constantly moving in different directions and speeds. It has been shown to be very protective of its home.

It has large yellow bands on its shoulders and wrists, and a yellow sloping section on its chest that appears to be its head. This section contains seven black circular \"eyes\" arranged in a specific pattern. The pattern is Regigigas's way of showing its anger; its eyes glow red when it is provoked.

Regigigas has long arms, with three fairly human-like white fingers, and short legs. Its body is covered in black stripes, and it has large bushes of moss growing in its back and feet.\n\nRegigigas is an extremely skilled craftsman. Long ago, it created five golems in its image and brought them to life. It used ice, rocks, magma, a cluster of electric energy, and crystallized dragon energy to create these golems. They'd be known as the Legendary Pokémon Regice, Regirock, Registeel, Regieleki, and Regidrago. Regigigas is also capable of controlling these legendary giants, even if they already belong to a Trainer. It can also survive extreme conditions as it is able to work with the boiling temperatures of magma as well as frigid ice (−328 °F / −200 °C). When Regigigas is disturbed from its slumber, it goes on a rampage and shoots powerful beams of energy. When it is befriended however, it'll become a calm and gentle giant. According to an enduring Sinnoh legend, after it created the legendary giants, Regigigas pulled landmasses together and binded them with ropes to create the regions of the Pokémon world. At some point, Regigigas fell into a deep sleep inside the Snowpoint Temple. To reawaken it, one must unlock the door the chamber where Regigigas is sealed in.\n\nRegigigas is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Crush Grip.

Its six legs are thick and have golden claws. Two golden half-circles similar to those on its neck are on each side of each leg, resembling shackles. It has a tail with two band-like markings.\n\nAccording to the myths and legends of the Sinnoh region, in the beginning of time, the Mythical Pokémon Arceus created the Pokémon of antimatter–Giratina, the Pokémon of time–Dialga, and the Pokémon of space–Palkia, all three in their Origin Formes. After the Pokémon universe was created, due to Giratina's violent nature, Arceus banished it to the Distortion World, a world that lies on the reverse side of the Pokémon world. Since then, Giratina carried a strong grudge against its creator Arceus and was willing to stand against it with the help of a human named Volo, but after being beaten by a human from another time and fleeing, it would start to change its ways and protect the universe from threats such as Cyrus, who had a similar goal to its former partner.\n\nGiratina is highly aggressive and territorial, likely other reasons for its banishment. It has been reported to appear in ancient cemeteries. Giratina has the power to tear holes in reality, sometimes even creating a space-time rift. It is so big and powerful that it can even throw both Dialga and Palkia into a frienzy. The rift will also create smaller Space-time distortions all over the region it was created in. The rift can also release lightnings that drive noble Pokémon into a frenzy as well. It is also capable of cloaking itself in darkness as it attacks. It generally moves by levitating itself in the air, as opposed to walking on its six legs. Giratina is said to be equal in strength to its siblings Dialga and Palkia.\n\nDue to its typically violent nature, the history of Giratina was covered up out of fear from the ancient Sinnoh people. Giratina is said to have observed the real world silently while in its home dimension. It remains in its Altered Forme while outside of its home dimension. Unlike in the games, Pokémon movies depict Giratina only opening portals through reflective surfaces. Giratina also had many different titles throughout the years: \"the banished Pokémon\", \"Arceus's shadow\", \"the Pokémon of Shadows\", and \"the being on the other side of our world\".\n\nGiratina is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shadow Force by leveling up, which gives it the ability to temporarily turn invisible."

The pattern of striated gray of Arceus's underbelly continues past its waist. Its limbs have gray undersides and extrusions at the tops of the legs. Arceus's tail is similar to its mane in terms of shape and coloration. Despite its quadruped appearance, Arceus is capable of flight.\n\nAccording to legend, it shaped the Pokémon universe using its 1,000 arms. Arceus has been referred to as the \"Original One\" in myths and legends and is generally considered one of the strongest Pokémon. Arceus is believed to be the creator of the Sinnoh and Ransei regions and possibly the entire Pokémon universe, along with the lake guardians: Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit, as well as the Pokémon of Myth: Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina. Because of this, Arceus is thought to be one of the longest-lived Pokémon species. It has the power to recreate the Pokémon of Myth as well, presumably to guard the dimensions when a Trainer has caught one of them. In Arceus and the Jewel of Life, Arceus is portrayed as having powers such as bringing back things that it once destroyed, making certain things vanish into thin air, halting time, and overturning the very laws of nature. In the same movie, it is said to \"feed\" off the energy of its Plates.\n\nArceus does not suffer fools gladly and will attack in a violent rampage if betrayed or deceived. It also holds long grudges if betrayed by those it considered friends. In Hoopa and the Clash of Ages, it was shown to be able to stop the destruction caused by a space-time void. As shown in the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode Showdown at the Gates of Warp!, Arceus has the power to not only calm Dialga and Palkia, but also destroy the Red Chain controlling them. It can release countless shots of light that disintegrate the landscape around it. Arceus can change its type at will to adapt to a situation through the use of its Plates or type-specific Z-Crystals. Arceus also has the power to split in two, creating a piece of itself to exist outside of its realm, which is implied to be its physical form—only a piece of its whole being—while its true form is unknown and incomprehensible.\n\nArceus was known to care for and safeguard the planet in ancient times, protecting the world from cataclysms such as meteors, and it would show gratitude and compassion to those who treated it with kindness. In modern times, Arceus continues to watch over the world and wishes for people and Pokémon to work together in the face of adversity. Even when it is needed, it only gives hints on how to solve problems instead of directly interfering. Arceus can also give its blessing to other Pokémon through bolts of light, making them bigger and more powerful, as seen with the ancient hero's 10 Pokémon companions. This blessing is also passed down through family lines, as seen with the descendants of the hero's Pokémon: the noble Pokémon and ride Pokémon worshipped by the people of Hisui.\n\nIn Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Arceus transformed a normal cellphone into an Arc Phone, a device that allows humans to communicate with it through text messages. Arceus also has the power to appear in dreams and create a variety of Pokémon to serve as challenges, as seen in Eternal Battle Reverie. In Pokémon Masters EX, through the sync stones ultimate, Arceus can give its blessing to a Trainer it deems worthy, transforming their outfits into costumes known as arc suits. As a result, their sync pair is blessed as well, granting them a divine move over their normal sync move. In Arceus and the Jewel of Life, using its Earth, Splash, Meadow, Zap, and Draco Plates, Arceus created the Jewel of Life, a powerful artifact capable of turning a desolate land into a rich and fertile one.\n\nAs seen in the introduction sequence of Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Arceus resides in a realm beyond time and space. There, it appears as a large amount of golden light shaped like the silhouette of its normal appearance. This is supposedly its true form. It was also shown to be capable of human speech, stating that \"Arceus\" is simply the name humans call it. The first ancient inhabitants of the Hisui region, the Celestica people, worshipped it, referring to it as \"almighty Sinnoh\", \"great Sinnoh\", and \"might of Sinnoh\", with the term \"Sinnoh\" later on becoming the name of the region. The Diamond Clan and Pearl Clan also worship it, though they mistook Dialga and Palkia respectively for Arceus. In ancient myths, it is said that the Origin Ore, an ore of mysterious power, contains the power of Arceus itself. In Alola, Arceus was used by the Aether Foundation as the inspiration during the Beast killer project to create the artificial Pokémon named Type: Full, with an Ability similar to Arceus's. However, the project was deemed a failure and was later abandoned, sealing Type: Full's ability with a control helmet, which caused it to devolve and be renamed Type: Null.\n\nArceus is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Judgment. It is also able to use charged-up versions of the Pokémon of Myth's signature moves (Roar of Time, Spacial Rend and Shadow Force), as seen in its boss battle in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. Additionally, Arceus is the only known Pokémon that can have Multitype as an Ability."

They have a green, ovoid body, tapering off in the rear to a trapezoidal tail fin. A thick black stripe covers the top of their body from mouth to tail and a white, dorsal fin with four protrusions resembling spikes. Their lower jaw juts ahead of their upper jaw, with a small indent near the edges of their mouth. Both forms have three black dots on both sides of their body, behind their pectoral fins.\n\nThe main difference between the three forms of Basculin is the color of the stripe that separates the black and green on their body.

Its body is mostly light brown with the exception of black stripes crossing over and under its legs and its pink underbelly. It has a black stripe on its snout in front of its eyes, and black covering the tip of its tail. Its eyes resemble shaded binoculars and are shrouded in a black membrane all around their front. This membrane prevents sand from getting in Sandile's eyes and helps it see in the harsh desert sun. Its long snout is tipped by two protruding nostrils, and its mouth comprises the bottom half. Its feet are flat and contain three sharp, black claws. They are attached to stubby legs on its sides.\n\nSandile is only found in deserts, with the exception of Alola, where the warm environment is comfortable enough for them to appear elsewhere. It usually burrows under the surface of the sand, with only its nose and eyes appearing above ground. Due to being so close to the surface, it can move around the desert and allow the heat of the sand to regulate its body temperature. This also serves as a way of hiding from enemies. Its movement through sand has been described as being similar to swimming. When the sun sets, it burrows deep into the sand to sleep until sunrise. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode A Sandile Gusher of Change!, in the wild, Sandile can be mischievous and potentially troublesome to humans. However, Sandile will protect another of its species, and can be caring at times. Sandile is an ambush predator, hiding under the sand and waiting for unwary prey, such as Trapinch, to walk over it before it bites on their legs. However, Sandile is not very skilled at hunting prey, thus it also mostly eats anything that collapses in the desert; hence it has been known as \"the cleaner of the desert.\""

Two of its front and rear teeth are visible overlapping its lower jaw. A black stripe sits on the bridge of the snout just behind its large nostrils.\n\nKrokorok prefers to live in the desert, usually in small groups. The black membrane surrounding its eyes protects them from sandstorms and acts as a thermal detector. This allows Krokorok to see the temperature of different objects, which also gives it exceptional night vision. This enables it to hunt in the dead of night without getting lost. However, it never moves much during the night. A group of Krokorok usually consists of a few individuals. The group is led by a female Krokorok while the males gather food. Krokorok dislikes feeling cold, so it burrows into the desert sand at night. It tends to bury its prey in the sand to preserve them in the event of an unsuccessful hunt."

Its long, thin fingers are each tipped with a white claw.\n\nIts head is slightly pointed and contains a distinctive black membrane that surrounds both eyes. The outline of the membrane angles upward sharply, coming to points above the top of Krookodile's head. It uses this distinctive look to harshly intimidate opponents. Its eyes are very powerful, with variable focus, allowing it to see things at a great distance, even in the middle of a desert. Its other notable feature is its long snout, containing a black stripe around the bridge, and large pointed nostrils on the end. Four of its rear and two of its front teeth slightly overlap its lower jaw. Krookodile's jaws are extremely powerful, giving it the ability to crush objects as large and durable as an automobile. The jaws can twist a body before breaking it in half. These features are topped by Krookodile's extremely violent temper. It has been known to clamp down on any moving object and will do everything it can to make sure its prey cannot escape. Krookodile coexists well with Flygon in searching for food, hiding in the sandstorms that Flygon creates as they hunt, then splitting the prey that they manage to catch.\n\nKrookodile has been known as the \"Bully of the Sands\". It uses the sandy terrain as cover to patiently wait for prey to pass by, even throughout the day without rest. Krookodile can swim through the desert sands as if they were water. Not even a thick metal plate is able to withstand a Krookodile's strong jaw bite.\n\nPrior to Generation VIII, Power Trip was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."

This tail acts like a broom or mop, as Minccino uses it to clean its den. The way it uses the tail to clean can be helpful when cleaning, but this Pokémon’s focus on a clean environment can make cleaning more of a hassle. Minccino also uses the tail to brush others of its species as a form of greeting; in a pair greeting, the one with the fluffier tail will be more prideful. It has a fondness for shiny objects and prefers clean habitats, and it is obsessed with cleaning dirty items. Minccino always keeps its tail clean; when it gets dirty, Minccino will wash it in clean spring water.\n\nPrior to Generation VIII, Tail Slap was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via breeding."

Alomomola's entire body is enveloped in a special membrane that can heal wounds.\n\nAlomomola lives in the open seas. If it finds an injured Pokémon floating at sea, it will heal the Pokémon's wounds using its membrane and carry it back to shore. Alomomola does this because any predators coming for the injured Pokémon could also come for Alomomola. Alomomola swims alongside smaller Pokémon to accompany them; thus, many water Pokémon gather around it. Fishermen take Alomomola during long voyages, saving the need to have a doctor or medicine on ships."

    "solution": "This is joltik, and is a Bug/Electric-type Pokemon. Joltik (Japanese: バチュル Bachuru) is a dual-type Bug/Electric Pokémon introduced in Generation V.\n\nIt evolves into Galvantula starting at level 36.\nJoltik is a tiny arachnid Pokémon. It has four legs tipped with blue, conical feet. Its ovoid body is completely covered in yellow fur, with notable tufts sticking out on each side of its face, just over each eye, and its lower back. Joltik has four blue eyes. The two larger eyes are set relatively far apart on its face, containing black pupils. The two smaller simple eyes are situated between the first pair, slightly higher up on its face. Joltik's mandibles point downward and reside at the bottom of its face, where they closely resemble tufts of hair. It is capable of producing silk from these mandibles, enabling it to hang from trees.\n\nAt 4 inches (0.1 meters) tall, Joltik is one of the shortest Pokémon in existence. In fact, it is too small to generate its own electricity, so it attaches itself to larger Pokémon and feeds off their static electricity. More than often it prefers sticking on Yamper's hindquarters. It will also make its way into houses and feed off electricity in electrical sockets. All of the energy it absorbs it stores in an electric pouch on its body. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Oshawott's Lost Scalchop!, Joltik is not especially aggressive, but will defend itself if bothered. In the episode Crisis at Chargestone Cave!, it's shown that if Joltik is unable to find a source of energy, it will be unable to move and be put in serious danger. Joltik mainly lives in caves and cities with electricity."

Galvantula (Japanese: デンチュラ Dentula) is a dual-type Bug/Electric Pokémon introduced in Generation V.\n\nIt evolves from Joltik starting at level 36.\nGalvantula is a yellow arachnid Pokémon. Its body consists of a head and abdomen. Its head is yellow on top and light purple on the bottom. It has two large, blue, forward-facing eyes with black pupils, and four, smaller, simple eyes sitting in a 2×2 pattern on its forehead. It has two long pedipalps connected from the underside of its head, which are blue and hairless on their lower half and covered in thick yellow fur on the upper half. Galvantula's body is covered in yellow and light purple fur on top with blue fur under its abdomen. Four tufts of hair sprout from under its abdomen and grow upward. Two large tufts sprout from the left and right of the rear, while two smaller ones sprout from each side. The fur on its back is light purple and with three thick, yellow stripes running up from its rear. Despite being based on a spider, Galvantula has only four legs. Each leg is connected to the head by a blue upper half. The lower half is covered in yellow fur and forms a bell-shape over its blue, conical feet.\n\nGalvantula likes to use electrically charged silk to ensnare prey. Galvantula preys on the chicks of bird Pokémon that cannot fly, by placing electrified threads near the nests. Galvantula attacks its foes with electricity by using the fur located on its abdomen. The electricity stuns the victim which can last three days and three nights. This allows Galvantula to consume the target at its leisure. Its pedipalps are very strong, allowing Galvantula to hold down unruly prey. It also uses electric webs to defend itself from threats. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Scraggy—Hatched to be Wild!, Galvantula is not particularly aggressive unless provoked. If bothered, it may attack in groups. In the episode Crisis at Chargestone Cave!, it is shown to be extremely caring and protective of its pre-evolved form, Joltik, and will aggressively find ways to help it."

Ferroseed's aim at throwing spikes will not be good at first, requiring practice to improve it. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: Black & White episode Crisis at Ferroseed Research!, Ferroseed can absorb nutrients from rocks and use them to grow moss for oxygen; different rocks create different types of moss with a variety of effects. Notably, its spikes can grow big and strong from consuming the moss.

Accelgor (Japanese: アギルダー Agilder) is a Bug-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.\n\nIt evolves from Shelmet when traded for a Karrablast, a Pokémon that evolves into Escavalier simultaneously. Neither evolves if at least one holds an Everstone during the trade.\nAccelgor is a Pokémon which has a large pink head reminiscent of a helmet that is curled in the back. Green stripes run from its eyes to the top of its head, and there is a black star-like marking or hole on the front. Its eyes are hidden in a shadowed crevice in its head. The rest of its body is covered by a blue, cloth-like membrane, which keeps Accelgor from dehydrating, with ribbon-like extensions at the top of its back. Its arms, when crossed, portray an aggressive mood.\n\nIt is a very fast Pokémon and attacks in ways similar to ninjas. In Generation VIII, Water Shuriken was its signature move. It lives in moist habitats like bogs and swamps. Accelgor is often featured as a main character in movies or comics to increase the popularity of these products. Accelgor's pouting expression and crossed arms are due to it being miserable over having lost its shell."

Neither Unovan Stunfisk nor Galarian Stunfisk are known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\nStunfisk is a flat, fishlike Pokémon with a broad, mud-brown body. At the base of its yellow tail is a yellow marking shaped like an exclamation mark when seen from behind. These markings can generate electricity. It has small, horizontal, oval-shaped eyes, white with a tiny black pupil and no irises. Almost exactly between these two eyes lies the two thick gray lips that form its mouth. It has two small, flimsy fins at the sides of its body; each with two lobes. It has been seen to leap into the air and flap its fins as if they're wings to remain airborne.\n\nStunfisk lives in mudflats and coastal areas, and thanks to the bacteria which lived alongside it, it developed the organs which it uses to generate electricity. Stunfisk's very tough skin keeps them unharmed if stepped on, even by sumo wrestlers. To exploit this, it buries itself in the mud of the seashore and waits for prey to pass by. Whenever unsuspecting prey touches a Stunfisk's body, it is zapped. Stunfisk smiles when electrocuting its foes for a reason that is still not yet known. If it cannot paralyze its foe, it contorts itself with unexpected speed and flops away."

It has a long, skinny tail that, like its paw fur, is tipped purple and split at its end. Mienshao is respectful and is usually seen training with its Trainer.\n\nWhen facing a truly challenging opponent, Mienshao will bite off the fur from its arms to make itself lighter. Its arm fur is used as a weapon in battle and acts like a battle whip. Before it attacks, it lets out a bizarre wail. It then creates combination attacks that are difficult to see and overwhelmingly unstoppable, and slowly stores up power for a finishing blow. When using its blinding speed, Mienshao can crush massive boulders into tiny pieces. A New Perspective demonstrates that Mienshao can extend the fur on its arms at will and stretch it far enough to tie its opponents."

There is an unproven theory that Golurk contains a perpetual motion machine that creates a limitless amount of energy.\n\nDespite its large size, Golurk is capable of flying by retracting its hands into its arms and its legs and feet into its body, then taking off like a rocket at Mach speeds. It is also capable of forming a cannon by pulling its legs into its body and standing on its hands, as seen in PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond, the animated series, and the Pokémon Adventures manga. If the seal on its chest is removed, its energy runs wild, and its energy's color turns from yellow to red. This causes it to rage and fly around uncontrollably without being able to land itself. Removing the seal also causes Golurk to attack indiscriminately. A rampaging Golurk can turn a whole town into a mountain of rubble.\n\nGolurk is said to have been invented by ancient people to serve as a laborer and protector of people and Pokémon. It also served as sentries on artillery platforms built into the walls of ancient castles, where it could fire energy beams. Golurk will faithfully follow its master's orders without question."

Resembling shoulder pads, Bisharp's red shoulders project slightly over its arms and have a thin yellow line where they meet its black torso. It has white, metallic hands that resemble gloves, with retractable, sharp blades attached. Encircling its torso are two blades, which create the impression of a ribcage. Its thighs are red and become progressively thinner as they connect to the knee. Both of its feet are metallic and split down the middle, resembling cloven hooves. These hooves are also similar to steel war boots or possibly leggings.\n\nIn the wild, Bisharp rules over a pack of Pawniard, and fights other Bisharp to become the alpha of the pack. The loser of these fights is cast out. It is notably pitiless, having no expression when finishing off prey, and is also said to use underhanded tactics during battles. When hunting, the Pawniard allow the leader Bisharp to perform the finishing blow. Once a Bisharp's head blade is chipped or damaged, it retires from its position as boss. Bisharp keeps a close eye on members of its pack to ensure none of the Pawniard think about betraying it, and absorbs defeated packs into its own tribe during territorial disputes. The Bisharp tribes are in turn spearheaded by Kingambit, which has been known to lead gangs of Bisharp into battle. It is said that only the most outstanding members of the Bisharp tribes can evolve into Kingambit. Bisharp typically lives near forested areas. It has violent conflicts with Fraxure over the locations of sharpening stones, and is often attacked by Tinkatuff for its metal."

Hydreigon lives high up in the air and has been known to ambush opponents from above. Many stories described Hydreigon destroying entire villages. However, Hydreigon is afraid of Noivern during nighttime. It is said Hydreigon's reason for being ferocious is due to ancient people loathing it.

Larvesta (Japanese: メラルバ Merlarva) is a dual-type Bug/Fire Pokémon introduced in Generation V.\n\nIt evolves into Volcarona starting at level 59.\nLarvesta is a fuzzy, moth larva-like Pokémon. It has blue eyes in a shadowed face. Its white mane of fuzz encompasses its head and the upper half of its body, while its lower half is brown. It has three pairs of small black legs. There are five red, slightly whorled horns on the sides of its head.\n\nLarvesta can shoot fire from its five horns as a defensive tactic to intimidate predators or to scare prey. It has been seen using the fire that it shoots from these horns to fly. Larvesta's flames can reach up to almost 5,500 degrees Fahrenheit in temperature. The horns' flames can cut through even sheets of iron. It lives at the feet of volcanoes, though people of ancient times once believed that Larvesta nested on and fell from the sun; some people still say that it was born from the sun. In ancient times, it was known as the Larva That Stole the Sun and emissary of the sun. Despite this, Larvesta is considered a burden due to it causing constant forest fires. When it evolves into Volcarona, its body becomes enveloped in flames, akin to a cocoon."

Volcarona's flames are said to provide a replacement for the sun when the atmosphere is dark with volcanic ash, and some legends claim that it hatched from a cocoon of raging flames to save people and Pokémon in freezing climates. It was feared as the rage of the sun by ancient people, and it was even worshiped as a deity of fire in some places, they even referred to it as the embodiment of the sun. Volcarona's shrine in Relic Castle remains as a testament to the respect it commanded. Despite being worshiped in cold regions, it is unpopular in hot regions due to its burning body. Volcarona is also considered dangerous due to how it scatters hot burning scales, which can rob the surrounding air of its oxygen.\n\nSlither Wing and Iron Moth bear a resemblance to Volcarona. Slither Wing is believed to be a revived ancestor of Volcarona. Iron Moth is believed to be Volcarona's descendant, possibly a UFO being controlled by alien life for observation. However, according to a Professor SadaS/TuroV brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, both Pokémon are counterparts of Volcarona from parallel timelines.\n\nVolcarona and its Future Paradox Pokémon counterpart, Iron Moth, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Fiery Dance."

One day, Keldeo took off from the forest with no one knowing why. When the four met again in the Moor of Icirrus, they taught Keldeo the move Secret Sword. When Keldeo left, it started crossing the world and often appeared at beautiful watersides. It travels in order to further improve itself through training. Like Suicune, Keldeo can also walk across the water by ejecting water from its hooves.\n\nIn Generation V, Sacred Sword was one of its signature moves. Keldeo is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Secret Sword."

Meloetta (Japanese: メロエッタ Meloetta) is a dual-type Normal/Psychic Mythical Pokémon introduced in Generation V.\n\nWhile it is not known to evolve into or from any Pokémon, Meloetta has two forms: its default form, Aria Forme, and a second form, the Normal/Fighting-type Pirouette Forme. Meloetta changes forms when it uses the move Relic Song during a battle and reverts to Aria Forme when switched out or when the battle ends.\n\nMeloetta was leaked on a poster for the fifteenth Pokémon movie, Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice, on February 26, 2012, and was officially revealed by Oha Suta on March 1, 2012.\n\nIn Pokémon the Series: Black & White, it is associated with the forces of nature.\nMeloetta is a Pokémon that has a femininely anthropomorphic figure with musical bar-style streaks in its hair, quarter notes (crotchets) (♩) for its arms and hands and pupil-less eyes resembling whole notes (semibreves). It has a jewel on its forehead and a black headpiece that seems to be shaped like a treble clef, which doubles as an attached microphone such as one often used by singers. Its ovular head seems to be a third of its body's height and about half its height in width. In its Aria Forme, Meloetta has light blue eyes and flowing, wavy hair with light-blue ovals that resemble whole notes. In its Pirouette Forme, it has auburn hair that seems to be stylized in a high bun and red eyes. In both forms, its midriff and eyes match its hair. It is a gender-unknown species.\n\nAccording to artists in Unova, Meloetta's beautiful music and dance inspired many works of art, music, and songs. This made the Pokémon popular among both musicians and dancers. Meloetta's melody has a special vocalization method. Meloetta's melody can control the feelings of those who hear it. It can make both humans and Pokémon feel happy or sad through this method. The song can also unseal ancient ruins such as the Abyssal Ruins. At one point, Meloetta can lose its signature melody and ability to dance should the world be filled with sorrow. Like many other Legendary and Mythical Pokémon, Meloetta is capable of flying and temporarily turning invisible. Meloetta's song can be channeled to summon and control the original three forces of nature Pokémon in connection with the Reveal Glass. However, this process can cause Meloetta agonizing pain in the process."

The Drive's light is visibly different depending on which one Genesect is holding.\n\nGenesect was leaked in the August issue of CoroCoro magazine on July 11, 2012, and it was officially revealed on July 14, 2012.\n\nGenesect is the last Pokémon in both the original Unova Pokédex as well as Black 2 and White 2's Unova Pokédex.\nGenesect is a bipedal, insectoid Pokémon with a metal body and a saucer-shaped head. It is primarily purple with several gray markings. It has two large red eyes that are capable of glowing, and a small white part that could be either its mouth or a vent. It has thin arms with overlapping segments. Each arm ends with a single, pointed claw from which it can spin a sticky string to create structures. There is a gray circle on each shoulder and a gray band around its abdomen. Its segmented legs each end with a large, upward-curving claw.\n\nGenesect was revived from a Fossil and technologically enhanced by Team Plasma to create the most powerful Pokémon ever. N had the project canceled and the P2 Laboratory closed because he felt that Pokémon, who he thought to be perfect beings, would lose their beauty if modified by science. However, Scientist Dudley kept working on it, angry that N denied his talent. This scientist reconstructed Genesect and installed the cannon on its back. According to a Hiker in Ambrette Town's Fossil Lab, there is a rumor that Genesect can be found in Glittering Cave.\n\nBy folding up its limbs and connecting its head to the cannon on its back, Genesect assumes a disk-like form known as the high-speed flight configuration (Japanese: 高速飛行形態 Kōsoku Hikō Keitai, \"high-speed flight configuration\"), allowing it to fly at remarkable speeds. As seen in Genesect and the Legend Awakened, Genesect can breathe in outer space. In the movie, it can also produce a sticky silk-like substance that rapidly hardens into brownish stone-like substance. It uses that material to create its nest. The movie also shows that one Genesect may lead the others of its group, being even capable of controlling them to follow its orders."

Quilladin has three white, clawed digits on its hands and two on its feet.\n\nQuilladin is not aggressive and never starts fights, although it is known to exercise its lower body by running into other Quilladin. When it is forced to defend itself, it relies on its shell to deflect attacks, before counterattacking with its sharp quills. The shell of Quilladin is both sturdy and heavy, which naturally strengthens the lower body of Quilladin. A Quilladin's tackle is powerful enough to send a trailer flying. Due to this body, Quilladin is immune to pain, not even violent collisions will faze it.\n\nPrior to Generation VII, Quilladin and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokémon that could have Bulletproof as an Ability."

Its head and upper body are covered in fluffy purple fur or feathers. The exact hue varies: they are vivid purple in the official art, and pinkish-purple in all other appearances of the Pokémon. Around its lower body is an even fluffier mass of pink fur, resembling a skirt. There is a black bow on its lower back. It has a pale blue-gray face with a small, curved beak or snout that resembles a mask worn by plague doctors or a masquerade mask. Its eyes are black with red sclerae and pupils and full black lashes. It has two wavy ears or tufts with yellow centers on its head. Each of its hands has three yellow claws, and it has paw-like feet with three toes.\n\nAromatisse can give off a variety of different smells, ranging from a pleasant fragrance to bolster its allies to an odor so repugnant that its opponent loses the will to fight. The scent emitted by its pink fur is so strong that its companions and Trainer will gradually lose the ability to smell. In Generation VI, Aromatic Mist was its signature move. Additionally, prior to Generation VIII, Aromatisse and its pre-evolved form, Spritzee, were the only known Pokémon that could have Aroma Veil as an Ability."

It has a transparent mantle with a rounded, pink body inside that has several yellow, circular spots that can glow brightly. There are four of these luminescent spots on the front and two on the back. Attached to its mantle are two transparent tentacles; its remaining tentacles are part of its main body, eight in total. It has round black eyes and a pink beak-like mouth.\n\nInkay can cause its luminescent spots to blink and flash; this behavior serves a variety of uses. If Inkay is threatened, the blinking lights will cause its opponents to become dazed and lose their will to battle, allowing it to escape. The blinking also serves to attract Inkay's prey, which is then ensnared and held in place by its tentacles. Inkay also uses various complex rhythms and patterns of lights to communicate to others of its kind. Because of this, Inkay instinctively reacts to anything in its habitat that emits light or echoing sounds. By floating upside-down, Inkay improves its blood flow along with clearing its head. This also drastically boosts the power of Inkay's Psychic moves and is what triggers its evolution into Malamar.\n\nPrior to Generation VIII and in Generation IX, Inkay and its evolved form, Malamar, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Topsy-Turvy."

On each side of the mantle is a long tentacle with dark pink at the top and white, scythe-like fins at the ends. The edge of Malamar's fins are said to be supremely sharp.\n\nMalamar possesses strong hypnotic powers, which are said to be the most powerful of any Pokémon. Malamar uses its hypnotic power to force others to do its bidding. Those under Malamar's control will lose their memories surrounding the event. People often utilize this ability for nefarious deeds. Malamar's hypnotic powers are said to have played a role in several history-changing events. It lures prey with the flashing pattern on its luminescent body and hypnotic motions, then ensnares them in its tentacles. The prey is then finished off with digestive fluids. Both the animated series and the TCG show Malamar living near water or even under water. As shown in the Pokémon the Series: XY episode Kalos, Where Dreams and Adventures Begin!, it uses its tentacles to propel itself, swimming leg-first. As depicted in A Conspiracy to Conquer! and Facing the Grand Design!, Malamar is shown to be highly intelligent, reaching almost human levels, and capable of running devices designed and handled by humans.\n\nPrior to Generation VIII and in Generation IX, Malamar and its pre-evolved form, Inkay, were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Topsy-Turvy."

It has three pairs of light gray legs; two pairs have simple blue spikes, while the foremost pair forms a larger set of claws. One claw forms a single, sharp point; and the other is much larger and forms a more traditional pincer, with a tiny yellow lower claw and a yellow circular pattern with two stripes on the back. Each front claw has a black stripe across the top. It has a pair of yellow antennae on top of its head, yellow eyes, and three pointed mandibles. There are three black stripes along its back that separate its body into segments, and it has a light gray underside. Two black, rectangular fins form its tail.\n\nClauncher's large claw gives it a poor sense of balance and makes it difficult to swim straight. Instead, it moves by firing compressed water from this claw. This is achieved through controlled expulsions of internal gas. Additionally, it uses this ability to shoot down flying prey and can shatter rock at close range. Occasionally, its claws will fall off, causing it to go into hiding until the claws grow back. The meat inside its claws is said to be delicious; however, it has a characteristic taste that is not universally loved. Clauncher's claws are a popular delicacy in places like Galar and Paldea. Dreepy is known to bite on Clauncher, although it does not actually feed on them; this is said to be a behavior carried over from when it was alive.\n\nFrom Generation VIII onward, Clauncher and its evolved form, Clawitzer, are the only known Pokémon that can have Mega Launcher as an Ability."

It has round black ears with pale yellow interiors, black eyes, a tiny nose, and a prominent upper incisor with a slight point. On each cheek is a circular, dark orange electric sac with two black whiskers. The upper whiskers have branches and resemble antennae, while the lower whiskers are simple. There is a thick black stripe down its back and it has a pale yellow belly. It has stubby limbs with three digits on each paw and a long, thin black tail with a tuft of fur on the tip.\n\nDedenne's upper whiskers serve as antennae that can send and receive electrical waves. This allows it to communicate with others of its kind over great distances, sharing locations of food or electricity, and sense its surroundings. The simple, lower whiskers are organs that can fire electricity. However, Dedenne is small and its electricity-generating organ is under-developed, making it unable to generate a lot of electricity on its own. It absorbs electricity from other electric Pokémon, or from homes and buildings by plugging its tail into outlets; Dedenne are known to live near humans due to this behavior. When it is low on charge, it curls up and sleeps. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Dedenne will occasionally fall asleep while sucking on its tail. It is believed that Dedenne does this due to being happy with all the electricity it absorbed."

Carbink (Japanese: メレシー Melecie) is a dual-type Rock/Fairy Pokémon introduced in Generation VI.\n\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, although it is considered a relative of Diancie.\nCarbink is a gray, rock-like Pokémon with a conical body. Its body has light blue crystals of various shapes and sizes embedded in it. A white, fluffy collar surrounds its small head. It uses this soft mane to polish the gems of other Carbink. It has bright blue eyes, a light blue crystal on top of its head, and flat diamond-shaped ears. In some media depictions, the fluffy collar, ears, and pattern of the blue crystals on the Carbink’s body can differ based on size and crystal pattern. Due to its small stature, it ties with Minior and Dwebble as the shortest Rock-type Pokémon.\n\nCarbink is born from the high temperatures and pressures underground. Since then, it has slept underground for millions of years. It is also occasionally found during cave excavations. It is known to compare its hard body with those of Geodude and Roggenrola. It is known to be preyed upon by Sableye, and caught by Gabite. Carbink defends itself by shooting high-energy beams from the gem on its head and other parts of its body. Although Carbink are not specially rare, the jewels on its body draw the attention from people. Rarely, Carbink will undergo a strange mutation and transform into the Mythical Pokémon Diancie. It is said that a pack of Carbink lives with a Diancie queen in a jeweled kingdom deep underground. It is also said that there lies a mineral vein housing another, larger pack of Carbink with another Diancie queen. Carbink is also one of the few Pokémon found in the Area Zero Underdepths."

Refer to Game data→Evolution data for these details.)\nGoomy is a Pokémon that resembles a slug or a slime with beady black eyes. The lower half of its body is light purple, while the upper half is a paler shade of purple. Along the dividing line of the two colors are five large, green spots. The front part of this line is its mouth. On top of its head are two pairs of antenna-like horns; the hind pair is longer than the front pair. These sensitive horns are used to check its surroundings.\n\nGoomy is considered the weakest Dragon-type Pokémon. Its body is mostly water and is covered by a germ-laden mucous membrane. This slimy layer causes physical attacks to slide off harmlessly. However, it becomes unable to breathe and will die if its body dries out. Because of this, it stays in damp, shady areas. Goomy's horns have powerful sensors that allow it to locate any sign of the enemy, allowing it to survive any kind of danger. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: XY episode A Slippery Encounter!, its diet consists of leaves.\n\nIn Hisui, when Goomy evolves into Sliggoo, it gains an additional Steel-type along with a metallic spiral shell due to its mucus having a reaction to the iron-rich waters of the region.\n\nGoomy and its Hisuian evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shelter. Additionally, prior to Generation IX, Goomy and its evolved forms were the only known Pokémon that could have Gooey as an Ability."

On top of its head are two pairs of antenna-like horns; the front horns are small nubs, while the hind horns are considerably longer. Its gelatinous body forms a spiral shell-like structure on its back. Contained within the shell are its brain, heart, and other organs.\n\nSliggoo excretes and coats its body with sticky mucus that can dissolve anything. Because it lacks teeth, it sprays this liquid onto prey and slurps them up once they are dissolved. Since its slime can melt through anything, predators stay far away from it. Its eyes have devolved, causing it to go blind. This makes it difficult for it to tell allies from prey and it will sometimes attempt to melt its companions. Its four horns act as a radar system and are used to detect sounds and smells. Sliggoo only cares about food and will flee from its enemies whenever possible.\n\nPrior to Generation IX, Sliggoo and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokémon that could have Gooey as an Ability."

A pale green slime is usually visible dripping from its chin and arms. It is known for having a great affinity for water, being able to live within water with no difficulty at all, as well as dive and surf all around the area.\n\nBecause of its meek, friendly nature, Goodra is often teased for supposed weakness. Goodra is known to be very friendly. When it grows close to someone, it will hug them and leave them coated in slime. If it is left alone, it will ooze gooey tears. Goodra usually misunderstands instructions, appearing dazed or bewildered. Despite this, many Trainers don't mind it, instead finding this behavior to be adorable. However, it will strike at its tormentors with its retractable horns and powerful tail. Goodra can become uncontrollable once enraged. The horns can hit 100 times harder than the blow of a heavyweight boxer. It is also capable of throwing punches with incredible force. Its slimy coating in combination with a layer of fat causes attacks to slide off. Goodra lives in plains and mountains, usually during rainy days.\n\nPrior to Generation IX, Goodra and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokémon that could have Gooey as an Ability."

Below its head is its pink, teardrop-shaped body with a white, teardrop-shaped marking in the middle. Extending from the top of its head is a horn that resembles an old-fashioned key with two wide, blunt teeth. Extending from either side of the key is a thin loop that surrounds Klefki. Hanging from the loop are various keys that this Pokémon has collected. As seen in the TCG, the loop is highly mobile and can split both at the top and the bottom, allowing Klefki to collect new keys and even express its feelings. Klefki is very tiny, tying with Alolan Diglett and Meltan as the shortest Steel-type.\n\nKlefki are known to be very even-tempered. In the past, Klefki inhabited mines. When the minerals on which it fed became scarce, it moved on to human settlements. It now feeds on metal ions by inserting its key-like horn into chinks in metal. It likes to collect keys, particularly master keys, and will sneak into people's homes to steal them. It collects keys to feed on their metal ions, as well as to threaten predators by rattling its collection at them. It is said that Klefki's key-like appearance is the result of an adaptation to suit its habit of collecting keys. Although it feeds on keys, it will never release a key it likes, holding onto to it for decades, so people will give it important keys as a way to prevent theft. However, on rare occasions, it will discard a key without second thought. In the past, nobles kept Klefki for generations, taking great care of them while entrusting them with important vault keys.\n\nKlefki is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Fairy Lock. In Generation VI, Crafty Shield was also one of its signature moves."

Its default form, Hoopa Confined, will then become the dual-type Psychic/Dark Hoopa Unbound. In Generation VI and VII, Hoopa Unbound will revert into Hoopa Confined while in the player's party if three days have passed since changing to Hoopa Unbound. Other circumstances may also cause it to revert.\n\n(Refer to Game data→Form data for more details.)\n\nHoopa Confined was officially revealed in the February 2015 issue of CoroCoro magazine, whereas Hoopa Unbound was revealed by CoroCoro three months later.\nHoopa Confined is a light-purple Pokémon with a vaguely humanoid appearance. It has green eyes with yellow sclerae, a yellow ring marking on its forehead, a small, pink dot under each eye, and dark pink hair tied into a short ponytail. On either side of its head is a dark gray horn that curves slightly upward. Its body has a dark pink, V-shaped marking on the chest and a small, golden spike on each shoulder. Its arms are not attached to its body and instead float next to it; each arm has a small golden spike similar to those on its shoulders. It has mitten-like hands and dark pink rings around each wrist. In place of actual legs, it has a wispy tail. Hoopa has three gold rings: a large one around its waist and one hanging freely on each of its horns.\n\nIn the past, Hoopa's true power is said to have been sealed away in the Prison Bottle for the destruction it used to cause, reducing Hoopa to its smaller, weaker form; opening the bottle grants Hoopa its true form once again, but only for three days. The rings on Hoopa's body can warp space and allow it to transport items, humans, and Pokémon by passing them through its hoops. This power allows it to cause mischief and take anything it wants. Hoopa is connected to many strange events becuase of these mysterious powers. It stores all of its gathered loot in a secret spot only it knows. Hoopa is said to have the power to bend dimensions. It is heavily implied to be the one causing many of the Mirage spots in the Hoenn region. As seen in Pokémon Masters EX, Hoopa can even bring people and Pokémon from alternate timelines. Hoopa is also known to like donuts.\n\nHoopa's lair is rumored to be located inside an hidden desert oasis. This lair contains many objects and treasures Hoopa obtained over the years, claiming as its own. Hoopa's lair is believed to contain mountains of gold and silver treasures it stole from ancient kings and wealthy land barons. To the present day, no one has ever found Hoopa's lair due to how well hidden it is. Hoopa can be very vengeful to those who attempt to manipulate it for its unqiue power. According to one tale, it punished an organization by transporting their individual objects before moving their headquarter to the middle of the desert. This incident terrified the organization to the point of disbanding.\n\nHoopa Confined is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Hyperspace Hole."

It has pointed ears with blue interiors, bright blue eyes, yellow markings over and behind its eyes that resemble eyebrows and eyelashes, a pointed, yellow mandible, and a spike-like protrusion on each cheek. Its body is divided into three segments: a considerably larger front portion that has a hunched back, a thin, blue waist, and smaller hips that resemble its front portion. On its chest are four yellow, diamond-shaped bumps. There is a thin, yellow band around each of its leg joints and the lower, maroon portions of its legs are larger than the thin, blue upper portions. Each ankle has a short, blunt growth, while each foot has three yellow claws. Volcanion has a short, tapering tail with a slightly shorter blue bump along the top. On the back of the front portion of its body are two arm-like cannons. These cannons are normally held together and form a ring around the back. Each cannon is separated into three segments by bright blue lines and each segment has a single blue dot and a short, blunt growth. The topmost segments also have four small, yellow bumps around the ends.\n\nVolcanion has an organ that allows it to vaporize the water it absorbs instantly with extremely high temperatures. The arms on Volcanion's back expel the resulting steam from inside its body, allowing it to disappear into the dense fog. It can expel steam of superbly high pressure and has the ability to blow away mountains. Volcanion is capable of creating explosive shockwaves. This power also allows Volcanion to gouge out the earth and changing the land by reshaping it. It's said to live in mountains where humans do not tread. Volcanion can run out of water within its body to use, as depicted in the movie Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel. When it does, a sound similar to a bell is heard, the lines and dots on its cannons turn red, and it is unable to use any Water-type moves until it refills its water supply from another source. It was also shown that Volcanion can live for several centuries.\n\nVolcanion is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Steam Eruption."

Most of its plumage, including its heart-shaped facial disc, is white, but it has dark brown feathers covering its head, shoulders, and back. Its large eyes contain dark irises and usually appear closed. It also has a stubby beak with a white upper jaw and an orange-brown lower jaw, and a few short tufts of feathers on the back of its head. Two green leaves curve around its face, resembling an asymmetric cut; the leaf on its right is longer than the one on the left. Under its chin are two smaller leaves that resemble a bowtie, and there are two pointed ones on its rear that form its tail. Its wings have two tan spots on the upper side and leafy plumage close to the body on the underside. Within the leaves under its wings are two sharp orange-brown feathers known as blade quills. Dartrix has orange-brown talons with two toes facing forward and one facing backward.\n\nThis alert Pokémon is sensitive to the presence of others around it, and is capable of launching attacks on unseen enemies behind it. It propels its blade quills at enemies or prey with astounding precision. By bending the feathers, it can even alter the trajectory of its strikes. However, it can occasionally miss hitting at times. Dartrix is narcissistic by nature, spending a lot of time grooming its feathers to maintain its appearance. This compulsion will occasionally lead to it losing focus when its plumage is ruffled or dirty, even retiring from battle to preen. It has been described as a bit of a birdbrain as it has a tendency to make mistakes; when it does, it sometimes tries to cover it up, which ends up making the situation worse. A Trainer who helps Dartrix through this difficult stage of its life will allow it to reach its full strength. Conversely, Dartrix will refuse to listen to a Trainer who doesn't diligently help it groom.\n\nIn Hisui, Dartrix tends to expose itself to sunlight in order to gain power, presumably due to the region's cold climate. As a result of the harsh environment, Dartrix becomes more sturdy when it evolves into Hisuian Decidueye, gaining the Fighting type instead of the Ghost type.\n\nDartrix and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon that can have the Ability Long Reach."

It will scratch those who try to pet it without earning its trust, which takes some time to develop. While grooming, Litten collects fur inside its stomach. By setting the stored fur alight, it can spit fireballs that change based on how it coughs. Litten's fur produces flammable oils, and when it begins shedding, it burns all its fur in a blaze. Its fur coat regrows twice a year. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy."

Its upper half, which includes its tail, is covered mostly in dark gray fur, while the fur on its lower half is mostly reddish orange. On its back, a stripe of reddish orange fur runs down its spine, with other two smaller horizontal stripes going across it. A similar fur pattern is seen on Torracat's face, though now it moreso resembles an upside-down double cross: the vertical stripe extends up from its head, forming a short cowlick, and the lowest horizontal stripes tilt upwards into a V-shape above its eyes, forming its eyebrows. Its eyes have yellow irises and black pupils with a red tint at the bottom and are heavily outlined in black fur. Its ears are pointed up and have light gray fur at the base. It has a short muzzle, a tiny triangular white nose, and tufts of fur sprouting from each of its cheeks, which make up its mane. Its tail is thicker the farther away from the body and ends in several tufts of fur, giving the impression it has blown up. Its forelegs are more developed than its hind legs, capable of bending iron with a single blow. Each paw has three tows, with the front ones being larger and ending on short black claws. On its tail and legs, there are two rings of opposite-colored fur.\n\nHanging from Torracat's neck is a round, bell-like organ, which is yellow with an orange core. This fiery organ is actually Torracat's flame sac, which produces the flames it uses to attack; when it does so, the organ sometimes flares with wing-like projections to the sides. The fire bell responds to Torracat's emotions, blazing hotter according to its spirits, and rings brightly whenever it spews fire or in the heat of battle. As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Exhibition Unmasked!, its fire bell is also capable of absorbing flames from outside sources and converting them into its own power. In addition, Torracat's mane acts as a sensory organ, allowing it to navigate in darkness and sense hidden foes. It is also an indicator of its wellbeing, standing on end when it is in a good mood and lying flat when it is not feeling well.\n\nTorracat loves to battle, and its relentless onslaught causes others to lose the will to fight. Outside of battle, it sometimes behaves like a spoiled child in front of its Trainer and other Pokémon, showcasing a more affectionate side to itself in comparison to its pre-evolved form. It, however, still is fickle and fitted with sharp claws, leaving those it has grown to trust marked with scratches."

It is the final form of Litten.\nIncineroar is a humanoid feline Pokémon with a muscular build. It has a short snout with a small red nose, bright green eyes with yellow sclerae, and tiny, pointed ears. Large tufts of red fur extend from its cheeks, and much of its face is also red. The upper half of its muzzle and the top and back of its head are black. A thin red stripe runs vertically along its head to its snout, where it splits into a V-shape over its eyes. Its torso is gray with several black stripes and seems to resemble a wrestler's tank top; the front and back both have a single vertical stripe up the center, crossed by two horizontal lines. Around Incineroar's waist is a belt formed from flames that somewhat resembles a championship wrestling belt. In the front center is a small, yellow flame shape. The arms, legs, and tail are all red with black stripes forming bands around them. The arms have three stripes, spiky tufts of black fur over the shoulders, and large five-fingered hands with white claws and a single light red pad on the palm. Its legs have only two stripes and simple three-toed paws, and the tail has one stripe and a tuft of spiky black fur around the tip.\n\nIncineroar's flame belt is produced from within its body and bursts from its navel and waist as its fighting spirit rises. In addition to spewing fire from its navel, it uses ferocious kicks and punches. Incineroar is an expert on no-holds-barred battles. The flames from its navel can reach a temperature of up to 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. This Pokémon disregards the safety of its opponents and on-lookers, sometimes striking the opposing Trainer with attacks. Incineroar usually attacks first by unleashing both ferocious punches and flinging furious kick combos and then finishing the opponent by spewing fire from its navel. It is a violent Pokémon with rough, aggressive, and egotistical behavior. It will sometimes ignore its Trainer's orders when it is not in the mood to listen. Despite this, it finds fighting unworthy opponents boring and gets motivated to fight a challenging one. Weak or injured opponents also cause them to lose the desire to fight, which others sometimes use to their advantage.\n\nIt also values the attention of the crowd as Incineroar's spirit goes up while the crowd is excited or falters when the crowd is bored. When Incineroar's fighting spirit rises, so does the temperature around its navel waist. While it tends to act like a heel, Incineroar is very happy internally when receiving the admiration of children or young Pokémon. It is also willing to help out children and small Pokémon, further showing its hidden soft side.\n\nIn Generation VII, Darkest Lariat was its signature move.\n\nIncineroar is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Malicious Moonsault."

Its front flippers are much longer than its tail flippers, although both have white tips. There are three digits on the front flippers.\n\nBrionne is a skillful dancer. While it normally learns to dance from members of its colony, Brionne can also learn to dance from humans.

It is capable of dancing in perfect time with others, even if it's never danced with them before. Large groups of Brionne can be seen dancing together on moonlit nights when the sea is calm, sometimes being led by the singing of a Primarina. Brionne has a caring nature; if its Trainer is feeling down, it will perform a dance to cheer them up.\n\nAs Brionne dances, it creates water balloons in a variety of colors. Its battle strategy consists of dancing while creating water balloons. The dance confuses the opponent, and during this weakness, Brionne slaps the balloons toward the target where they explode.

    "solution": "This is pikipek, and is a Normal/Flying-type Pokemon. Pikipek (Japanese: ツツケラ Tsutsukera) is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.\n\nIt evolves into Trumbeak starting at level 14, which evolves into Toucannon starting at level 28.\nPikipek is an avian Pokémon with black plumage. Its gray beak is long with a pointed, black tip, and it has large blue eyes. There is a white, mask-like marking on its face. This marking extends down its neck before ending in a tuft of feathers on its chest. A large crest sweeps upward from the back of its head with a red stripe along the top that ends at its beak. The undersides of Pikipek's wings are white, and it has thin gray legs and feet. It has a flat tail.\n\nDespite its slender appearance, Pikipek has powerful neck muscles and is able to strike 16 times per second with its beak. Pikipek does not feel pain when using its neck muscles. This allows it to not only drill through wood, but shatter stone as well. The holes it drills in trees are used for nesting, storing food, and collecting small, glittering objects. The noise of this Pokémon pecking can be used to communicate with others. This Pokémon feeds on Berries and is able to attack opponents by zipping the leftover seeds at them. These shots have enough force to embed the seeds in trees. Talonflame is a natural predator of Pikipek, while Pikipek itself preys on Metapod. It generally lives in humid forests."

Around its neck is a jagged, red band, and it has a long tail with three tail feathers. It has spindly blue legs with two toes facing forward and two facing backward.\n\nTrumbeak feeds on Berries and stores the seeds in its beak so it can fire them off in a burst when encountering both enemies and prey. New plants grow from the seeds that Trumbeak scatters. The cries that it makes with its beak prove to be very noisy to its neighbors. Trumbeak lives in areas dense with trees."

Toucannon (Japanese: ドデカバシ Dodekabashi) is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.\n\nIt evolves from Trumbeak starting at level 28. It is the final form of Pikipek.\nToucannon is an avian Pokémon with black feathers and a prominent beak similar to a toucan, with the upper part being larger than the lower part, or the mandible. There are gases inside its beak, which can ignite and launch seeds with enough force to shatter boulders. Additionally, its temperature can exceed 212 °F (100 °C) and cause severe burns on contact. Toucannon can use this beak to warm up eggs, as seen in the Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon episode First Catch in Alola, Ketchum-Style!.\n\nExcept for the black tip on the upper part, Toucannon's beak can change colors as it heats up, although it normally has four bands of red, orange, and yellow at the top, and solid red on the mandible. As Toucannon heats up its beak, the bands on the upper beak glow and turn red (or sometimes bright yellow, as seen in the Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon episode Keeping Your Eyes on the Ball!) one-by-one, from tip to base. When its beak cools down, both of its parts are momentarily solid yellow, before resuming their normal colorations.\n\nAround the base of the beak is a thin black band with two extensions into the upper jaw similar to nostrils. There is a white marking covering Toucannon's chin and chest, and a half-circle, yellow marking on each cheek. Toucannon has dark blue eyes, light blue eyelids, and jagged, gray eyebrows. It has a long tail with a spiky ruff of red feathers around the base, and spindly blue legs. Each foot has two forward-facing toes with black talons and two rear-facing toes with no visible claws. Its tail seems to be bent specifically for the purpose of holding it momentarily, as it can stand on it for short periods, possibly as a brace when firing seeds.\n\nIn order to communicate, Toucannon strike each other with their beaks. The number and strength of the hits reflect how it is feeling. Toucannon is well known for forming loving couples, which makes it a common good luck charm at weddings.\n\nToucannon is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Beak Blast."

It is covered in brown fur with a yellow stripe down its back and underside. It has short, rounded ears on the sides of its head, a short snout with a pink nose, and a large mouth full of pointed teeth. There are three black claws on each of its four short legs. Despite its length, Yungoos is thick-bodied and has a wide, flat tail with longer fur on the tip.\n\nYungoos has a voracious appetite and is always hungry, which in turn makes it more ferocious. Much of its body is dominated by its stomach, and it is able to digest food quickly. Its strong teeth allow it to crush and consume the hardest of objects. This Pokémon stalks through its territory searching for food until it passes out from exhaustion. However, it is believed that Yungoos decides its territory based on safety so that it can collapse anywhere without fear. It is able to eat anything, but usually prefers fresh hunt. This Pokémon is found in Alola, although it is not native to the region and was imported there. Prior to Generation VIII, Yungoos and its evolved form, Gumshoos, were the only known Pokémon that could have Stakeout as an Ability."

Despite its length, Gumshoos is thick-bodied and has a wide, flat tail with longer fur on the tip.\n\nGumshoos hunts by patiently waiting along its prey's known travel routes and pouncing when the unsuspecting prey comes along. Due to its tenacious personality and ability to withstand intense hunger, it is able to wait for its prey for long periods without eating. Its favorite prey are Rattata and Raticate, but since Gumshoos is diurnal, it rarely encounters them. It is also known to prey on Skwovet. Once the sun sets, this Pokémon's stamina is depleted and it will fall asleep where it stands. It is not originally from Alola, and was brought over to take care of Rattata outbreaks.\n\nA special Gumshoos in Alola acts as the Totem Pokémon for Ilima's trial in Verdant Cavern. This Gumshoos possesses Z-Power, an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura.

The rest of its head is brown and has a reddish-orange structure with a yellow rim on top. It has large, black eyes with white pupils.\n\nGrubbin typically lives underground. It uses its jaw as a weapon, a tool for burrowing, and for extracting sap from trees. Additionally, it can create sticky threads, which it shoots from its mouth and uses to swing around as though on suspension wires. It also uses these threads to stop opponents from moving, so it can then grab them in its mandibles, which are strong enough to snap thick tree branches. Even its natural enemies, such as Rookidee and Hoothoot, would rather run away than risk getting caught in its mandibles. It loves electricity and can be found near power plants. They can also be found near Electric-type Pokémon, as a means of avoiding attacks from bird-like Pokémon. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Grubbin uses its mandibles to makes nests underground. It has been observed sleeping in the dirt. It is believed that the dirt it sleeps in is possibly fluffy and comfortable."

Refer to Game data→Evolution data for these details.)\nCharjabug is a small, cuboid Pokémon resembling an insect. Its body consists of three square segments. The last two sections have a thin, ring-like marking and a stubby brown leg on each side. Each eye is covered by a blue screen and is only visible when it glows. Two short, yellow spikes extend from the front square: one on each side of its rectangular mouth. The mouth itself is gray and has two jaws that close sideways, shaped like a lightning bolt when open.\n\nCharjabug is often found half-buried in earth or leaves, munching on large quantities of humus. The sturdy shell covering Charjabug's body protects it from attacks, allowing it to eat peacefully. This diet helps Charjabug evolve into Vikavolt. In its body is an electric sac, which it uses to store electricity generated by digesting food. The electricity it stores could run a household for a whole day and can be shared with other Pokémon. People on camping trips are grateful to have a Charjabug around. It can discharge electricity from the tips of its jaws to attack especially persistent opponents. Charjabug will zap anyone who accidentally steps on it. As shown in the Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon episode Rise and Shine, Starship!, it can send sound waves to communicate with nearby Grubbin. Vikavolt is known to clasp Charjabug in between its legs and use it as a battery to enhance its Electric-type moves, unless it is in an aerial battle. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Charjabug releases electricity while it sleeps. The reason is due it still digesting the meal it consumes.\n\nCharjabug is the only known Pokémon that can have Battery as an Ability."

Its small orange face has robotic, yellow eyes and is covered by a blue carapace. The mandibles extend from this helmet. They are blue on the inner surface and yellow on the outer surface. At the base of each mandible is a large spike and the inside is lined with short spikes. Its body is black and divided into three sections by yellow rings. The last two sections have a yellow spot on each side. On its back is a pair of wide, flat wings that are transparent with blue elytra. It has four legs; the front pair of legs has two claws, while the back pair has only one.\n\nVikavolt produces electricity with an organ in its abdomen and controls it with its huge jaws to fire powerful electromagnetic beams. Vikavolt shoots these to strike down bird Pokémon. When it clasps a Charjabug in its legs, it is able to utilize it as an extra battery. This allows it to rapidly fire its powerful beam attacks. However, during fierce aerial fights, it will release Charjabug to make itself lighter and more mobile. It is an adept flier, capable of acrobatic maneuvers such as tailspins and sharp turns. Even as it weaves through complicated tangles of branches in the forest, it is able to maintain high-speed flight. It is known to have a rivalry with Pinsir and Heracross. As shown in the episode A High-Speed Awakening!, it likes to drink tree sap. In that same episode, it is shown that, in Alola, there is a competition known as the Vikavolt race, where Trainers can have their Vikavolt race for the chance to win a Buginium Z. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Vikavolt's mobility is exceptional, to the point it can remain flying while it sleeps. This usually happens after intense battles, where Vikavolt used up too much electricity. In preparation for its next battle, Vikavolt will sleep upside down in order to generate electricity in its abdomen.\n\nA special Vikavolt in Alola acts as the Totem Pokémon for Sophocles's trial in Hokulani Observatory.

Refer to Game data→Evolution data for details.)\nCrabrawler is a crustacean Pokémon resembling a crab. Most of its shell is purple with blue and yellow accents. It has two long, yellow antennae over its eyes. One blue eyelid is usually half-closed, giving it the appearance of a black eye. The purple shell covering its body appears to be made of three parts: two plain plates covering the shoulders and part of the chest and one plate covered in blue stripes across its underside. A large portion of its yellow body is visible down the center of its chest and a tiny spot is visible in the center of its back. Crabrawler has three pairs of legs. The two rear pairs are smaller with yellow joints and blue tips. The foremost pair of legs has large blue pincers resembling boxing gloves. There is a small amount of meat in its claws, which is considered delicious.\n\nA competitive Pokémon that hates to lose, this Pokémon uses its large claws to protect its face and belly while it closes in on opponents. Crabrawler's pincers sometimes break off from overuse but grow back quickly. Crabrawler's pincers are a popular ingredient for paella, making a tasty soup stock. Crabrawler strives to achieve not only a high social standing but a physically higher position as well. It can be found clinging to buildings or even tall people and will punch anyone who attempts to remove it from its perch. In the event that it does lose, its mouth will foam before it faints.\n\nWhile it is capable of splitting tree trunks, it usually punches trees to knock down ripe berries. Many Crabrawler will gather around a tree to compete for the ripe berries. Crabrawler also preys on Exeggcute. It has been known to mistake Exeggutor for coconut trees, which shake and stomp Crabrawler off when climbed. Crabrawler are known to cimb snowy mountains in order to reach the top. However, they tend to get lost and trapped up there. As a result, Crabrawler evovles into Crabominable in order to better adapt to the bitter cold."

The parts of Crabominable's body not covered in fur are dark blue in color, except for the light blue on its face, claws, and legs, as well as light blue stripes on its abdomen. On top of its head is a patch of yellow fur with two tufts extending upward. Its face has white eyes with slanted black pupils, and a large mouth where two blunt teeth are visible. Below its mouth is a dumbbell-shaped protrusion; together with its abdomen, they create the impression of pectoral and abdominal muscles. Its arms are segmented into three parts. The arm segments grow in size with the smallest being closest to the body. Its claws have a dark blue pawprint-shaped marking on the tips which create Bigfoot prints on snow. The mark that would be the \"palm\" of the paw is actually the lower half of the claw. Its four legs are short, with pointed tips that are freezing to the touch, as shown in Pokémon Refresh.\n\nIts evolution was triggered by exposure to the snowy mountains. Crabominable grew its fluffy fur to combat the icy cold of its mountain home. It can also store cold in its claws, which are capable of smashing ice walls or halting avalanches. In desperate times, the claws can even be fired like rockets. Additionally, Crabominable can freeze its opponents in place by firing icy bubbles from its mouth, which is useful since Crabominable has a slow movement speed. Crabominable's detached pincers are said to have a delicious taste; some Trainers have been known to use Lechonk just to find these pincers.\n\nPrior to Generation IX, Crabominable was the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Ice Hammer."

It has four spindly legs with round feet.\n\nCutiefly is capable of detecting the aura of living things, such as plants, people, and Pokémon. It uses this ability to predict the movements of its opponents. Cutiefly's diet consists of pollen and nectar, drinking it through its long proboscis. Any pollen it does not finish is stored in its fur. It collects nectar and pollen from flowers, which are found by the color and brightness of their auras. However, when a living creature is excited, its aura resembles a flower in full bloom. As a result, Cutiefly tends to gather around beings feeling strong emotions. When Cutiefly draws close, it will painfully poke them with its long proboscis. This Pokémon can be found in fields and meadows but is sometimes attracted to towns or buildings by the emotions of living beings. Loving nectar and pollen, it often gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food. It is known to be drawn in by Fomantis's sweet scent and Gossifleur's pollen.

The form Rockruff evolves into depends on the time, as well as its Ability, which corresponds to one of Rockruff's two visually indistinct forms.\n\n(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to Game data→Evolution data for these details.)\nLycanroc is a canine Pokémon resembling a wolf. It has three possible forms: Midday Form, Midnight Form, and Dusk Form. The first two forms are influenced by Solgaleo and Lunala when bathed in solar or lunar energy. The third form is said to have been influenced by the setting sun of the evening. Lycanroc are used by humans as guards, to protect their fields from prey Deerling.\n\nIn its Midday Form, Lycanroc resembles a quadrupedal, light brown wolf. It has a white underbelly that extends up around its muzzle and eyes in a mask-like marking. It has pointed ears with dark brown tips and pink insides, big blue eyes, and a triangular, dark brown nose. There are four sharp fangs in its mouth: two in the upper jaw and two in the lower. Large tufts of brown fur extend from the sides of its head; three tufts on each side. A bushy, white mane covers its neck. Four dark brown rocks poke out of its mane, creating a shape similar to a stylized sun. The rocks are said to be razor-sharp. The lower portions of this form's legs are white, and each foot has three dark brown claws. It also has a long, fluffy white tail.\n\nThe Midday Form has a calm, collected, and cautious personality. In order to avoid needless fighting, the Midday Form prefers to live alone and does not form a pack with others of its kind. However, it is a fiercely loyal partner to Trainers that accept it during its unruly stage. In battle, it darts past opponents while attacking them with the rocks in its mane. These swift movements leave many foes bewildered and backed into a corner. It always aims for the foes' weak spot using its fangs. Broken fragments of its stone mane are considered good luck.\n\nIn its Midnight Form, Lycanroc instead resembles a slouched, bipedal wolf or werewolf. It has short red fur with white on its lower legs and a white streak that covers its face, underbelly, and tail. It has pointed, button ears with black tips, three large tufts of fur on each side of its face, a triangular black nose, and a mouth full of sharp teeth. While the sclerae, irises, and pupils of its eye are visible, they all glow a pinkish red and no distinctive colors are visible. A mane of fur covers its back and shoulders, sweeping forward over its head to form a crescent moon shape. On either side of its body, just below the shoulders, two small rocks resembling claws poke out of the mane. A single, bigger stone projects out of the front of the mane over its head. Each of this form's paws has three black claws, and it has a stubby tail covered in long fur.\n\nIn contrast to its Midday Form, Lycanroc's Midnight Form is thrilled by battling and becomes more excited the stronger its opponent. This excitement is what causes its eyes to glow. The Midnight Form is known to be reckless along with extremely vicious temper. Its strategy consists of closing in on its opponent and encouraging attack, then countering with a powerful blow that knocks out its opponent. The full force of its headbutts can destroy giant boulders. Trainers that can draw out its power earn its trust, but it despises those that it disagrees with or who try to force it to fight.\n\nIn its Dusk Form, Lycanroc resembles a combination of its Midday and Midnight Forms. Its body is similar to Midday Form with the same white color except with orange-gold fur. It retains the three brown claws for all four feet. The white fluffy mane resembles a sun with part of the crescent moon. It also has four rocks around its neck like a sun as well along with a single, bigger stone coming from the mane over its head. Its face resembles Midday Form Lycanroc's but is orange-gold with bright green eyes, which can change to bright glowing red when angry or attacking.\n\nThe Dusk Form Lycanroc shares traits from the previous two forms. Its stance, calm demeanor, and loyal nature are shared with the Midday Form. However, it also shares the Midnight Form's fighting spirit, including the red, glowing eyes at the moment of attack. Dusk Form Lycanroc never barks, unlike its two other forms. Upon entering battle, Lycanroc will relentlessly drive its opponents into a corner. Due to only evolving at sunset, the Dusk Form is considered the rarest of the three forms. The Dusk Form of Lycanroc is rather difficult to train due to its temperamental nature. Because of this, Dusk Form Lycanroc is considered the most troublesome of its three forms.\n\nLycanroc is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Splintered Stormshards.\n\nLycanroc's Midday and Dusk Forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Accelerock."

When Wishiwashi enters a battle or ends a turn with its HP above 25%, it changes from Solo Form to School Form. School Form Wishiwashi will revert to Solo Form Wishiwashi if its HP is below 25%.\nWishiwashi is a fishlike Pokémon. It has two different forms depending on the situation.\n\nIn its Solo Form, Wishiwashi resembles a small fish. It has large, light blue eyes with irises that resemble puddles of water and dark blue eyelids. The head and tail are both white. There is a line of white teardrop-shapes on each side of its body with the teardrop nearest the head being slightly larger. The top half of its body is dark blue and has a short, rounded dorsal fin. The lower half of its body is gray with two pectoral fins. This tiny Pokémon is both the shortest and lightest Water-type.\n\nAn individual Wishiwashi is small, weak, and notably tasty. As a result Wishiwashi has numerous natural predators, including humans, Dewgong, Wailmer, Wailord, Wingull, and Pelipper. While Wishiwashi are known to move in schools, they're more often seen alone. Wishiwashi also gather when confronting opponents. It can call on its friends by shining its eyes seen as an SOS signal almost 25 miles (40 kilometers) away.\n\nWishiwashi is the only known Pokémon that can have Schooling as an Ability."

It has blue eyes with yellow pupils and sclerae, and three pointed teeth. The body consists of two sections; the top section is slightly smaller and overlaps the lower. On top of its head is a starfish-like collection of ten tentacles. All of the tentacles reach the ground, except for the one directly in front, which is shorter and leaves its face exposed. The tentacles are light blue and covered in purple spines. On top of its head is a purple area with a collection of spikes with a larger, yellow spine in the center.\n\nMareanie is able to regenerate any body part overnight, except its head. The lost limbs have a very bitter, astringent flavor, and thus they cannot be eaten as food. Bruxish feeds on Mareanie, which in turn eats the branches of Corsola — except in Galar, where it has not yet learned to prey on them. Mareanie also eats broken-off Pincurchin spines, despite the risk of getting electrocuted. It uses the spike on top of its head to poison its prey and uses its tentacles to either trap its prey or deal the final blow. In the Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon episode, The Sun, the Scare, the Secret Lair!, it is seen attaching itself with all of its tentacles and releasing poison through its spines. The poison causes numbness and intense itching. Mareanie live in groups and are found in beaches and the bottom of oceans.\n\nMareanie and its evolution, Toxapex, are the only known Pokémon that can have Merciless as an Ability."

Its head is dark blue on top, near where its legs connect. This part of its body is typically suspended in the air due to the length of its legs.\n\nThe legs themselves are light blue on top and dark blue on the undersides. The legs are filled with spines, which can protrude towards the outer leg or retract into the inner leg. The inner spines are purplish pink, and when they are present, the outer spines sink back into its legs, and vice versa. The tip of each leg has two orange claws, and there is a ring of orange spines around a purplish-pink marking where all the legs meet on top.\n\nToxapex uses its legs to walk along the ocean floor, where it hunts for Corsola. They can also be used to create a dome-like shelter, protecting it from the tides and, in colder regions, trapping its body heat to keep it warm. Toxapex's spines sense the flow of tides, allowing it to survey its surroundings. Its spines can also be fired at enemies and carry a powerful poison, which causes pain for 72 hours (3 days), even to Pokémon as large as Wailord. Aftereffects of the venom remain even after recovery. If a foe bypasses its spines, it attacks with its claws instead. Bruxish is its natural enemy.

It has a dark brown coat with a cream-colored underbelly, muzzle, and circular markings on each cheek. A short, teardrop-shaped blaze extends up from its muzzle, and it has long, pointed ears with pink insides. Its large eyes have horizontal pupils. Black bangs hang over its face before turning into a stiff mane along its neck. Additionally, it has a short, black tail. Thick, cream-colored mud surrounds each black hoof.\n\nMudbray can be kept happy by giving it time to frolic in and consume mud. Mudbray's diet consists of eating dirt in order to create mud. It then regurgitated the mud in order to cover itself in it. Mudbray's mud won't dry out, even when exposed to the sun for long periods of time. Denying it this will cause it to become stressed and disobey its Trainer. This Pokémon boasts immense strength for its size and is able to drag or carry loads up to 50 times its own weight. Mudbray are known to be skilled at using mud. The mud that collects around its hooves enhances its grip and power. Notably, it allows Mudbray to travel rough terrains without slipping. Because it was hunted nearly to extinction when it lived all over the world, it was believed for a time to run wild only in Alola. Despite this, Mudbray have been seen roaming in Galar and Paldea, suggesting that its population is slowly recovering from near extinction. Prior to Generation IX, Mudbray and its evolved form, Mudsdale, were the only known Pokémon that could have Stamina as an Ability."

Along the top of its neck, its mane is black with red at the tip, and stands up straight. On either side of its neck, the mane forms three thick structures similar to dreadlocks with red mud around the tips. The mane extends all the way down Mudsdale's back in a thin line before becoming its tail. The tail appears similar to its dreadlocks but is much larger and has several black notches missing from the mud around the tip. Around its hooves is a protective coating of red mud, which has three notches around the bottom.\n\nMudsdale is known for both its powerful body and emotional fortitude, which prevents it from becoming agitated. Regardless of the trouble it is in, it will never cry out and will defeat opponents with a single blow. The mud around its legs gives its kicks extra force; one kick can turn a car or large truck into a scrap pile. When galloping, its hooves can dig holes in asphalt. While it is not swift, it has excellent stamina and can continue on for three days and three nights while dragging over 10 tons. It will mix dirt and saliva to create a special mud with resistance to both wind and water. The mud is also harder than even stone. Because of its unique qualities, the walls of some old houses were coated with Mudsdale's mud. Mudsdale is highly treasured for both physical labor and pottery made from its high-quality mud.

A small, dark green bulb sprouts from the center of its head, which emits a pleasant aroma. Around its neck is a collar of short, dark green leaves. Extending from its collar are four lighter green leaves with white tips: two in the front and two in the back. In the front, these leaves act as scythe-like arms. Its main body is pale pink with a thick, dark pink stripe down the front and back. It has a stubby tail and two short legs.\n\nIn order to achieve evolution, Fomantis stores up energy gathered by photosynthesis. It is nocturnal, so during the day, it spreads its leaves wide to catch the sunlight. During the night, it spends its time searching for a new spot to sleep for the next day. It will not stay in the same spot for more than a day due to the danger involved. If anything bothers it while it is gathering sunlight, Fomantis will fiercely attack it. The reason is that Fomantis hates its naps being disturbed. When regularly exposed to sunlight, it grows up with vivid coloration. Though it excels at long-range attacks, it will rarely use those that require it to use its stored photosynthetic energy. Fomantis can give off a sweet and refreshing scent. Bug Pokémon like Cutiefly are known to gather near it due to its scent. Trainers who own Fomantis tend to give it a flowerpot, allowing it to sunbathe in peace."

Bounsweet (Japanese: アマカジ Amakaji) is a Grass-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.\n\nIt evolves into Steenee starting at level 18, which evolves into Tsareena when leveled up while knowing Stomp.\nBounsweet is a small Pokémon resembling a mangosteen. Most of its body is pinkish-purple with a short, white bottom around its waist, which resembles the flesh of a mangosteen when it is cut open. It has beady yellow eyes and two tiny legs. On top of its head is a green calyx. This structure consists of four leafy green formations and a short stem.\n\nThis Pokémon exudes a delicious smell from its entire body, which has made it popular with people of the Alola region. This scent has a calming effect on people, so they are often used as living air fresheners. However, its sweet scent has also caused it to be swallowed whole or collected by other Pokémon, especially Toucannon and Greedent. It is too sweet for human consumption, but its sweat can be used to make a juice. Bounsweet was highly valued by humans in the past in a time when sweets were rare.\n\nWhile fleeing danger, Bounsweet skips along in a way that does not convey its desperation. As a result, no one ever comes to help it. It has been known to drive away enemies by rotating its calyx, but it becomes dizzy afterward."

Its slender arms have slightly rounded hands with no visible digits, and its legs have pointed tips.\n\nWhile it has a delectable fragrance, this Pokémon also has a tomboyish personality that can make it hard to get along with. Steenee's scent is a popular antiperspirants used by humans and helps others feel invigorated. Steenee's peeled rind can be used for stomach pains. Its calyx has hardened, allowing it to play with other Pokémon without worrying about being damaged. However, the leaves spin as Steenee moves and often strike nearby objects. It apparently does not care what it hits, and even uses the calyx as a form of attack. Foes are struck with the leaves first, then kicked by one of Steenee's equally hard legs.. It also uses those legs to protect itself from its natural predator Corvisquire. Steenee has are known to bounce around the forests it lives in."

The lower part of its face is hidden behind a short ruff extending up from its body. While its arms are slender with rounded, digit-less hands, its legs are long and powerful. The upper portions of its legs have three pointed projections just before the hips, creating the impression of long boots. The lower portions of its legs taper into small, pointed feet. It has wide hips made up of six segments that resemble the flesh of a mangosteen. It is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\n\nOn top of Tsareena's head is a light green calyx.

On top of the calyx is a growth resembling a small, purple crown with four thin yellow stripes.\n\nTsareena is known to be both powerful and aggressive. This Pokémon has a high-class nature and punishes anyone who approaches it with evil in mind. This attitude will even be directed at its Trainer if given commands Tsareena dislikes, such as being told to use an ineffective move. Touching the crown-like growth on its head is said to render it defenseless, however, and instantly calms it down.\n\nTsareena fights using finely honed kicks and graceful movements. Every time it lands a hit, it cackles at its opponent. It will even continue kicking or stepping on a downed opponent, laughing boisterously. Additionally, its sweet fragrance acts as a distraction. Because only the most powerful Steenee evolve into Tsareena, this Pokémon uses its power to protect its pre-evolved forms. Quaquaval is Tsareena's rival in kicking.\n\nTsareena is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Trop Kick. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Queenly Majesty as an Ability."

Passimian tend to get into territorial disputes with Ambipom in their search for comfortable trees, in which they win half the time. This Pokémon's battle strategy involves throwing berries at opponents, hard ones for damage and soft ones to obscure vision, and confusing opponents by throwing the berry to other troop members. A troop's leader is the member that can throw these berries the farthest. Through rigorous training, the troop improves its coordination, teamwork, and skill in handling berries. Some Passimian are unable to handle the intensity and flee from the troop. In place of a troop leader, a captive Passimian looks to its Trainer for leadership.

It can suck the life force of people or Pokémon through its mouth. Apparently, in the Alola region, sticking a hand into Sandygast's mouth is a way of proving one's courage. A person who grabs Sandygast's shovel or puts a hand in its mouth falls under its control. Sandygast uses this power to make children add sand to its body so it can become bigger.

A tunnel through the center of the main body creates a mouth. There is a line of five alternating blue and pink seashells over the top of its mouth, and a similar ring of seashells surrounds the central tower just below the point. The central tower has six windows: three located in the front, one on each side, and one in the back.

The shovel on Palossand's head rotates when it searches for prey and is believed to function as a radar. Palossand can be found at beaches, having been referred to as the \"Beach Nightmare\"; however, it hates water. It cannot maintain its castle-like structure during heavy rainfall.

Its head is enclosed in a brown helmet with green markings, designed to suppress its power to stable levels. The helmet is extremely heavy and hinders its agility. The helmet has a large jaw piece that wraps around the front with large, round hinges on the side. Each hinge is covered by a green X-shaped marking. The name of the Pokémon, as it wears the helmet, is called Null meaning nothing. Small gray eyes can be seen from within rectangular black holes on the front, and there are two pointed ears on the top. Around the base is a collar with four protruding vanes that are tipped with a three-way spike. This collar has a thin green line between the vanes, and each vane has a green hexagon near the end. An axe-like blade with a band around the middle extends backward from the top of the helmet.

It was designed to be an \"Anti-UB Fighting life-form\", a weapon created to fight against the Ultra Beasts. Also known as \"beast killer\", Type: Null was developed with cells taken from all known Pokémon types. This was done with the intention of giving it the ability to shift between types by holding a corresponding memory, an ability originally inspired by the myths researched at Canalave Library. This ability led the Aether Foundation to name it \"Type: Full\". Three known models of Type: Full were created, but all three rejected the RKS System and went berserk. Faba had created limiter helmets for these Pokémon, and after being subdued, the three Type: Full were given the helmets to lessen the effects of the RKS System's rejection and were put into permanent cryogenic stasis. Thus, the beast killer project was deemed a failure, and the creature's name changed to Type: Null. At some point before the events of Generation VII, Gladion was able to free one of the Type: Null, which he adopted as his own in the hopes of finding a way to undo the effects of the limiter helmet and allow it to use the RKS System. Gladion would eventually rediscover its evolution, Type: Full, renaming it as Silvally. When Type: Null evolves into Silvally, it breaks the helmet it wears in the process. Prior to the events of Pokémon Sword and Shield, a new Type: Null is created in the Galar region, apparently by Macro Cosmos by utilizing research notes stolen from Alola. Being created to hunt down Ultra Beasts, as seen in Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon and Pokémon Adventures, Type: Null can feel the appearance of Ultra Beasts and the opening of Ultra Wormholes."

Minior (Japanese: メテノ Meteno) is a dual-type Rock/Flying Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.\n\nWhile it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Minior can change forms during battle, due to its Shields Down Ability, depending on its current HP. When Minior's HP is below half, it changes from Meteor Form to a form where its core is exposed. Exposed core Minior will revert back to Meteor Form if its HP is restored above 50%.\n\nMinior's exposed core can be one of seven colors, which are non-interchangeable and correspond to the colors of a rainbow. These forms are Red Core, Orange Core, Yellow Core, Green Core, Blue Core, Indigo Core, and Violet Core.\nMinior is a spherical Pokémon with two forms: one form with a rocky outer coating and the other with its core exposed. When it sheds its rocky coating, its exposed core form is both the lightest Rock-type and Flying-type Pokémon. Both of its forms tie with Carbink and Dwebble as the shortest Rock-type.\n\nIn its Meteor Form, Minior resembles a modestly sized rock. Its rocky exterior is formed by four large plates separated by two large cracks. The cracks encircle its body both horizontally and vertically. Five white spikes extend just above the rocky surface, giving it a star shape. Two large, black spots on its front resemble eyes, and there is a third spot in the center of its back. Rings of dark brown triangles surround the holes its spikes protrude from and the spot on its back, pointing outward. One of the triangles surrounding the spot on its back is replaced with a small, brown dot. The eyespots have a half-ring of triangles resembling eyelashes. One eye has a small, brown dot in the corner. Even while apparently at rest, Minior tends to spin slowly in place.\n\nWhen its core is exposed, Minior loses its rocky shell. The core is a bright, pastel color. Depending on the color of debris and food it absorbed and ate while in the stratosphere, Minior's core can be Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, or Violet. A handful of darker triangles are also visible on its body in random places. Minior's eyes and mouth are formed from energy that floats in front of its body like a two-dimensional mask. The eyes are two large swirls and the mouth is a smaller line. Its face tends to stay level regardless of how Minior spins the rest of its body. The colors of Minior's forms are determined by the composition of the dust it consumes.\n\nMinior forms in the stratosphere from an aggregation of mutated nanoparticles, where it absorbs particulate matter from which it builds its core and shell. When touched in Meteor Form, Minior will react when touched or called to, it is unknown if these responses indicate its consciousness. Eventually, this process makes it too heavy and it falls towards the surface of the planet. When its shell breaks from landing, Minior becomes lighter and capable of attacking quickly. However, it cannot survive for long with its core exposed, and will eventually die if not placed inside a Poké Ball quickly enough. Despite this, many fallen Minior will attempt to return to space, sadly being unable to return to space. Despite their wish to return home, all they can do is fade away without their shells. The cute, pastel coloring of Minior's core often inspires designers to use it as a motif for clothing and accessories. While in the ozone layer, it serves as food to stronger Pokémon such as Rayquaza. Minior's diet consists of eating dust. Places where Minior falls are few, Alola being one of them.\n\nMinior is the only known Pokémon that can have Shields Down as an Ability."

    "solution": "This is komala, and is a Normal-type Pokemon. Komala (Japanese: ネッコアラ Nekkoara) is a Normal-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.\n\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\nKomala is a blue-gray Pokémon similar to a koala. It has large, rounded ears with light orange fur on the inside. Its large, ovoid black nose extends up between its fluffy white eyebrows, and there are additional white puffs of fur on each cheek. There is a small ruff of longer, gray fur around its neck. Each hand is black with five short fingers, and it has three black claws and a black paw pad on each foot. Its underbelly is white, as is its short fluffy tail. Komala is usually seen holding a short wooden log, which it is given at birth. The log is typically a light brown with darker, oval markings all over it. The ends of the log are tan with the growth rings visible.\n\nThis Pokémon stays asleep from birth to death, staying this way because of its diet of certain leaves containing poison only Komala can break down, which induces sedative properties. While its expression sometimes changes as if it is aware of its surroundings, this appears to be a result of its dreams instead. It is able to eat, travel, and even battle without waking. If the log pillow it clings to is removed, it will be unable to sleep well and thrash wildly. However, it will sometimes cling to the arm of a Trainer it trusts. During a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether. According to ancient people, if a small amount of the saliva created when it eats leaves is watered down and ingested, one will be able to sleep well. This diluted saliva was also historically used as an anesthetic for surgeries. Hypno has been known to hunt this Pokémon in Alola, appearing to prefer them over humans.\n\nKomala is the only known Pokémon that can have Comatose as an Ability."

Turtonator (Japanese: バクガメス Bakugames) is a dual-type Fire/Dragon Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.\n\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\nTurtonator is a bipedal, turtle-like Pokémon with a spiny shell. Its skin is a muted green and only visible on its limbs, tail, head, and neck. On top of its head is an additional shell with many points around the brim. This extra shell has a black center, yellow in the middle, and a red outer rim. Its eyes have black markings around the bottom, and it has a tubular, yellow snout with a single, large nostril. Turtonator has a wide mouth with the lower lip marked by a jagged yellow line extending from its nose. On each side of Turtonator's long neck are two short, triangular projections. Its front legs have mitten-like hands, while its hind feet have claw-like red growths around them. Most of its tail is also covered by red plating, which has fin-like projections. The shell that encases its body has a red underside with a star-shaped, yellow-rimmed hole in the center. The back of the shell has a yellow center with several spikes: four large spikes with red bases form a star shape in the center with four smaller spikes around them.\n\nThis Pokémon resides on volcanoes, where it camouflages itself among the rocks and waits for prey. In addition to hunting, Turtonator also feeds on sulfur and other volcanic materials. This diet rich in explosive material has contributed to a layer of explosive material in its shell. This diet also makes Turtonator's feces dangerously explosive. The feces can be put to many different uses; in Pokémon Adventures, they can be used as makeshift landmines, exploding from a mere touch. When prey steps onto its shell, it strikes itself with its own tail to cause an explosion. The explosion is ignited by sparks from the spikes on its shell and released through the hole on its chest. This orifice also acts as Turtonator's weak point. Its explosive capabilities are dampened by the rain, however, so it takes refuge in caves on rainy days. It is also capable of spewing poisonous gas and flames from its nostrils.\n\nTurtonator is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Shell Trap."

Scattered across its back are 14 fur spikes that appear as yellow and brown triangular markings. When attacking, surprised, or agitated, these spikes will stand straight up. There is a tail-like needle on the back of its head. The needle is gray with a yellow tip and is shaped like a lightning bolt. Additionally, it has stubby arms and legs. When Togedemaru's spines are out, its cheek marks sometimes look like electrical outlets.\n\nTogedemaru uses the needle on top of its head to attract and gather electricity. Groups can be seen gathered with their needles standing upright, waiting to be struck by lightning on stormy days to make up for its somewhat limited electric capacity. Some Trainers use its ability to absorb electricity as a strategy in battle. The opponent is coaxed into unleashing an Electric-type attack, and then has that power turned against it. When it is pleased, this Pokémon will curl into a ball and roll around uncontrollably. Togedemaru clashes with Elekid whenever it tries to steal the latter's electricity, usually ending with even matches.\n\nA special Togedemaru in Alola acts as the Totem Pokémon for Sophocles's trial in Hokulani Observatory.

Its small size makes it one of the shortest Ghost types. Its eyes are beady black through the holes in the body of its disguise however, as seen in the animated series, its eyes are actually purple. Fringe of an amorphous foot or lower body is visible under the hem as well. Occasionally, it will also extend a long, black claw-like appendage from under its rag. When angered, its eyes will glow yellow. The veil itself resembles a Pikachu. The cloth is yellow with black-tipped ears. The Pikachu face appears to be drawn with crayons, consisting of black eyes, red cheeks, and a squiggly black mouth. The rag's head is hollow and can be used to store objects. Mimikyu also carries a small stick resembling a lightning bolt to create a tail for its costume. When its disguise is damaged, the costume's head droops limply backward, revealing Mimikyu's ruse. Larger rips in the costume are accompanied by shadowy vapors pouring out from whatever is hidden within.\n\nA lonely Pokémon, Mimikyu is always covered by its disguise. It is unknown what Mimikyu's true appearance looks like. However, glimpses of it are seen, such as its claw, its underside, and its eyes. Since this Pokémon is weakened by sunlight, it is rumored that the veil is used for protection. It is believed that seeing its true form will cause a mysterious illness or even a painful death. Because of this, Mimikyu will become agitated and violently stop anyone from attempting to look underneath its rag.\n\nMimikyu's disguise is modeled after Pikachu because of the popularity of Pikachu-styled merchandise, thinking that its disguise would allow it to make friends with people. It uses the disguise to bond more with humans and other Pokémon. Unfortunately, this attempt makes its disguise look more creepy. Until recent times, Mimikyu was initially thought by humans to be just a ghost wearing a cloth. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep, Mimikyu mimics Pikachu to the point it even sleeps similar to it. Its relationship to Pikachu can vary between individuals and canons, with some being antagonistic, as seen in Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon, or can be friendly, as shown in the short, A Mimikyu Bedtime Story.\n\nA special Mimikyu in Alola acts as the Totem Pokémon for Acerola's trial in an abandoned Thrifty Megamart.

On top of its head is a protuberance with a dark purple bulb at the tip. The bulb is able to open like a flower, which reveals a light blue orb in the center.\n\nThis Pokémon buries itself on the seafloor, leaving only the growth on its head exposed. By emitting a low level of psychic power, it serves as a radar to detect prey. Additionally, the protuberance can emit a strong psychic power. Opponents bathed in this power are stricken with terrible headaches and fall unconscious. Prey, which includes Shellder and Mareanie, are ground into mush and eaten. Toxapex is a rival of Bruxish in warm ocean currents.\n\nWhen emitting psychic power, Bruxish grinds its teeth, which stimulates its brain and creates psychic energy. This sound is enough to send nearby Pokémon fleeing immediately. In the Alola region, lifeguards allow this Pokémon to remain in their area to prevent other, dangerous Water Pokémon from gathering. Any sunlight reflecting on Bruxish's ripples will cause the water to shine brightly.\n\nBruxish is the only known Pokémon that can have Dazzling as an Ability.

A solid yellow scale of the same shape is on the tip of its tail. Each of its feet has three yellow claws.\n\nWhile Jangmo-o trains diligently and remains humble, it has the pride of a warrior. It employs the scale on its forehead for both attack and defense, so it never shows its back to its foe. Many Trainers take this behavior as proof of this Pokémon's valiant nature. Jangmo-o lives and trains with others of its kind in harsh areas that are far away from other Pokémon and people.

It has a rounded, beak-ish snout and small eyes nearly hidden under its head armor. On the tip of its snout is a patch of pale gray and both the upper and lower jaws have a small, tooth-like spike on each side. The top of its head is covered by an elaborate arrangement of scales. At the front of the headdress is an oval scale, which is yellow with a red heart-shape at the base. On either side of the front scale is a chain of four circular scales; the first three scales are red with yellow trim and the last scale is solid yellow. Three additional chains of plain yellow scales extend from the back of the headdress. Running down the front of its long neck is a line of overlapping scales: one solid gray at the top, three larger gray ones with yellow rims, and one solid yellow scale at the bottom. A thick yellow stripe with a rounded projection in the center runs across its chest. Covering its shoulders are tufts of spiky, white feathers with small, gray scales overlapping them.

The very tip of its tail is pale gray.\n\nKommo-o, having completed its harsh training, returns to its birthplace to protect Jangmo-o. However, it only watches over them from a distance. The power of this Pokémon's uppercut is enough to send foes flying, so simply raising its arms can generate enough force to change its surroundings. According to legend, Kommo-o's glittering scales are meant to drive away a great darkness. The reason it seeks strong opponents is also said to be a quest for power to defeat the darkness. Its scales function as both offensive weapons and defensive shields.\n\nBecause it does not wish to fight weak foes, it clangs its scales together when it senses someone approaching. Weak or cowardly opponents will panic at this sound and flee immediately. Kommo-o also swings the scales on its tail to threaten any enemies it sees. Upon finishing off its prey, Kommo-o will let out a victory howl. Additionally, the metallic sounds made by its comrades celebrating can also be heard all around the area the group is in.\n\nWhile the animated series shows that Kommo-o is capable of bipedal locomotion, the core series games since Generation VIII show that it vastly prefers to walk and run around by knuckle-walking.\n\nA special Kommo-o in Alola acts as the Totem Pokémon for an unmanned trial in Vast Poni Canyon.

Tapu Koko's head and torso are black with white markings on its chest, just above its eyes, and on top of its head. Extending from the top of its head is a large, orange plume with bristles along the back. There is a yellow marking covering the top bristle and half of the bristle below it. The bottom of this crest goes all the way to its neck, where it divides its face in half and creates a beak-like nose. It has small, blue eyes with yellow markings behind them. The lower half of its body is orange with four pointed projections: one short spine on the front and two short spines in the back, with one longer spine between them. These spines resemble a bird's tail feathers. Its thin arms have round, yellow structures encircling its shoulders. On each arm is a shell that appears to be half of a bird mask, and its hands end in two large claws to create a beak for the mask.\n\nThe mask itself is mostly yellow with black, orange, and white markings. There are three white triangular markings with black edges on the top of each half of the mask, which create diamond shapes when the mask is closed. The 'eyes' consist of a white diamond connected to a slightly larger orange diamond, which is inside a larger yellow diamond. Each of these shapes is edged in black. On each half of its beak is an orange triangle with a white rim. There are wing-shaped structures on each side, toward the back. Tapu Koko is able to pull the mask together and hide its upper body inside, creating the impression of a stylized rooster.\n\nThis Pokémon is called the guardian deity of Melemele Island. It's known for protecting its home, but it is fickle and will not necessarily help people in need. However, it is very curious and may come to play or battle with people or Pokémon that interest it. It is able to store electricity by closing itself inside the shells on its arms. It does this by summoning thunderclouds. It has an explosive temper, but it instantly forgets what enraged it in the first place. Due to this, Tapu Koko has been referred to as a malevolent deity should it get provoked. It can move lightning-fast in order to confuse enemies that fight it. Tapu Koko is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in Revealing the Stuff of Legend!, Tapu Koko and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring. Furthermore, in Battling the Beast Within!, it was shown to have the ability to transport others into Ultra Space when working together with another Tapu Koko.\n\nTapu Koko and the other guardian deities are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Nature's Madness.

On each side is a hexagon marking consisting of five dark pink triangles and one light pink triangle all outlined in black. These resemble the compound eyes of many insects. There are also projections on the back of the shell that resemble butterfly wings and a small black bump on the bottom similar to a curled proboscis. When closed, the shell resembles a bug's head with small wings.\n\nThe people of Akala Island worship Tapu Lele. This guardian of Akala Island is known to scatter glowing scales, which affect others by stimulating and healing their bodies; however, these scales are also dangerous if too many are touched at once. Some consider it to be guilelessly cruel for the way it destroys others as it scatters its scales for its own amusement. This has resulted in Tapu Lele being described as an incarnation of nature, the reason being it does not feel remorse for its cruel actions. An old legend says that Tapu Lele ended a war between Alola's islands by healing the tired warriors with its scales, but rumors point to a more disturbing truth behind this story. Its strength comes from the energy stored within its shell. If Tapu Lele finds itself at a disadvantage in battle, it will prioritize not outright losing as opposed to trying for a decisive victory.

Under each eye is a red line divided into three segments with a smaller, white line below that. There is a short white line above each eye. In the middle of its face is what appears to be a golden nose similar to a bull's snout. There is a white ring through the nostrils of the nose. On each side of its face is a thick white line that curves upward at the outer tip. There are red rings around its shoulders and golden, cloven hooves at the end of its arms. Its tail is mostly covered in a golden bell with two thin black rings around the top and a wavy black line around the bottom. A tuft of fur is just visible inside the bell. On top of its head is a pair of curved, black horns. Each horn has a thick yellow marking near the tip and half of a wooden shell attached to it.\n\nTapu Bulu's shell is primarily red with white and yellow markings thickly bordered by a muted black. The shell itself resembles a flower or plant when open; when closed, the horns shift to the sides and it takes on the appearance of a bull. The top of each half is slightly thicker than the bottom, which gives the \"bull\" a slightly protruding brow. At the bottom of each half is a white rectangle with a muted black triangle at the bottom. Above the rectangles are two triangular markings; the top triangle slightly overlaps a larger, yellow triangle. Behind and just touching the yellow triangle is a tiny, white rectangle that creates the \"bull's\" eyes. The side has a single, tiny yellow triangle marking.\n\nThis guardian of Ula'ula Island is able to command vegetation to grow and change shape to its will. Despite its fearsome power, it is largely inactive, leading some to consider it a lazy Pokémon. It has a peaceful disposition and does not like to cause unnecessary violence, so it rings the bell on its tail to alert others of its presence. However, it is merciless to those who offend it and it is said to have once repelled thieves from its ruins by swinging trees like clubs. The ruined Tapu Village stands as another example of the guardian's wrath. Tapu Bulu is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in Revealing the Stuff of Legend!, Tapu Bulu and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring.\n\nTapu Bulu and the other guardian deities are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Nature's Madness. They are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Guardian of Alola."

Tapu Fini (Japanese: カプ・レヒレ Kapu-Rehire) is a dual-type Water/Fairy Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.\n\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\n\nIt is the guardian deity of Poni Island, with Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Bulu being the deities of the other islands.\nTapu Fini is a vaguely swordfish-like Legendary Pokémon. Tapu Fini has a black body shaped similarly to a mermaid or fish. It has light blue eyes, white eyelids, and a light blue, fin-like marking around the outer corner of each eye. It has a white T-shaped marking on its forehead and a small, white V-shape on its chest. Around its shoulders are segmented purple rings and its long thin arms have webbed hands with three fingers. Each finger is tipped with a purple claw. On the front of its lower body is a light blue, fin-like projection with three spikes. It also has light blue fins on top of its head that resemble long, flowing hair.\n\nTapu Fini's main body resides inside a violet shell that resembles a swordfish head when closed. The top half of the shell has a fin with light blue webbing on top and a thin, pointed spine on the front. On each side of the top shell are two C-shaped markings facing each other to form a rough circle. One marking is white and one is light blue, but both are outlined in black. These markings form the \"eye\" of the swordfish. Along the edges of both shell halves are a series of white triangles with black outlines.\n\nAs the guardian of Poni Island, Tapu Fini can freely manipulate water and it gains energy from ocean currents. Tapu Fini is both respected and feared. To avoid harm to itself in battle, it shrouds its surroundings in a mysterious fog that sends its opponents into a self-destructive trance. The guardian also unleashes this fog as a test for those who seek the special water it can create, which is said to purify anything it touches. Many humans have attempted this trial, including those with ill intent; disgusted by this history, Tapu Fini does not care much for humans. Despite this, it is willing to help those who prove themselves worthy. As seen in Run, Heroes, Run!, Tapu Fini has shown to be able to make water clocks out of water and bridge the world of the living with the world of the dead using mist. As stated in Memories in the Mist!, long periods of exposure to this mist can trap people within it forever, specifically targeting those who cannot endure the pain of seeing a deceased loved one again. Tapu Fini is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in the Revealing the Stuff of Legend!, Tapu Fini and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring.\n\nTapu Fini and the other guardian deities are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Nature's Madness. They are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Guardian of Alola."

Cosmog (Japanese: コスモッグ Cosmog) is a Psychic-type Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.\n\nIt evolves into Cosmoem starting at level 43, which evolves into either Solgaleo or Lunala starting at level 53 depending on the game it evolves in.\n\nA Cosmog played an important role in Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon.\n\nIt is associated with the guardian deities. It was hypothesized to be an Ultra Beast.\nCosmog is a small Pokémon with a gaseous body similar to a nebula. The gases that make up its body range in color from violet to light blue. The very center of its body is black both in front and back. The black space on the front contains its face, which consists of beady yellow eyes, circular blue cheeks, and a small mouth. The space on the back has only a single blue dot. There is a golden half-circlet on both the top and bottom half of its body, which divides it exactly in half. Two wispy extensions containing starry specks serve as its arms. Cosmog's gaseous body makes it one of the lightest Pokémon in existence.\n\nCosmog's body is frail and easily blown away. However, it is carefree and doesn't seem to mind. It collects dust from the atmosphere, which allows it to grow slowly. Cosmog has the ability to warp itself and those close to it. Professor Mohn's research tells that Cosmog can also open Ultra Wormholes when under extreme stress. This process is very dangerous for Cosmog, and the use of its powers can leave it immobile for extended periods of time, or even fatal when used improperly. According to Lusamine, the gases from Cosmog can also be extracted to create Ultra Wormholes. Cosmog is theorized by the Aether Foundation to be a type of Ultra Beast, and its name was coined by one of the professors at the Foundation. In the ancient times, it was known as “The child of the stars” by the people of Alola. When angered, Cosmog's wisps will puff up in a comedic way. In behavior, Cosmog has an overly trusting nature and it immediately takes a liking to whoever shows it kindness, even when that person doesn't have the best intentions for it. Cosmog is known to be very curious but not very cautious; this behavior has often led to Cosmog willingly put itself in danger, only to teleport away should things get dicey. This Pokémon can also be created by Solgaleo and Lunala, probably as a some type of reproduction. The guardian deities watch and protect Cosmog until it fully evolves and returns to Ultra Space to repeat the cycle."

The main portion of the shell is a flat oval around the center of the orb. Eight more flat, half-oval projections surround the orb in an asterisk-shape. At the center of the main body is a much smaller black core. The upper half of the core has a thin blue line on the front, back, and each side, while the lower has pink lines. On the front are two orange semicircles, which appear to be closed eyes. The overall shape of this Pokémon also resembles an eye. When evolving, the Pokémon glows either an orange or a purple color, correlating to Solgaleo and Lunala, respectively, gaining traits of either a stylized sun or a stylized moon.\n\nEncased in its sturdy, cocoon-like shell, Cosmoem is unable to move. In Pokémon Refresh, it cannot even eat. It grows as it absorbs starlight and the dust in the air. Its body is warm to the touch. Cosmoem's shell is said to be harder than any known material. In ancient times, it was known as the \"cocoon of the stars\" by the people of Alola.\n\nCosmoem is one of the shortest Pokémon in existence. Despite this, it is also the heaviest Pokémon in existence, being tied with Celesteela. Cosmoem's height in the Pokédex is actually measured by its width, rather than its height, as seen in its concept art."

It enters this phase while using its signature move or traveling through Ultra Space. The phase is no longer present in the core series as of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.\n\nSolgaleo has long been honored as an emissary of the sun; in ancient times, it was known as \"the beast that devours the sun\". It is said to live in another world and returns there when its third eye activates. Its body is capable of holding a vast amount of energy and glows when active. The intense light it radiates can make nighttime look like midday. Solgaleo can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space. It can slam into its target with the force of a meteor. Alongside its counterpart Lunala, it can create Cosmog, which it is said to be the male evolution of. Solgaleo and Lunala also have the power to create Z-Crystals and even restore Necrozma's light, allowing it to return to its true, Ultra form.

The outside of the hood is yellow, while the inner part that curves around Lunala's head is white with deep blue streaks. Its torso resembles a ribcage with a slightly curved spike on each shoulder and three spikes extending from the bottom toward its tail. Its massive wings resemble a bat's wings with the skeleton exposed, except that Lunala's wings have a total of seven \"finger bones\": four running through each wing, one running along the edge to the outermost tip, and two pointing upwards that may act as claws that are more functional.

    "problem": "What is in the images?",
    "solution": "This is nihilego, and is a Rock/Poison-type Pokemon. Nihilego (Japanese: ウツロイド Uturoid) is a dual-type Rock/Poison Ultra Beast Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.\n\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\n\nIt is code-named UB-01 Symbiont (Japanese: ＵＢ０１ Ｐａｒａｓｉｔｅ).\nNihilego is an Ultra Beast that resembles a jellyfish. The bell is semi-translucent and encircled with several white, star-shaped markings. The wavy rim of the bell flares outward and is bright blue. Its tentacles appear gelatinous and give it a vaguely humanoid shape. Several tentacles mesh together forming the appearance of a cape or long hair, while four shorter tentacles resemble shorter hair and arms. Two long tentacles make up the legs of the human shape. According to its concept art, Nihilego's body is made of various types of glass.\n\nNihilego was the first Ultra Beast to be discovered by Professor Mohn of the Aether Foundation. He was also the one who coined Nihilego's name. Nihilego live in another world named Ultra Deep Sea. Although its exact levels of intelligence are unknown, it is believed to act upon a self-preservation instinct. However, in addition to its human-like shape, it is sometimes seen acting like a young girl. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Nihilego's most distinctive feature is its parasitic capability. When Nihilego latches on to a host's head, it does not manipulate its actions directly. Instead it awakens the host's own capabilities and boosts them to an extreme extent in order to protect itself. It injects the host with a sort of neurotoxin to achieve this effect. This neurotoxin of Nihilego's is incredibly stimulating and inspires feelings of extreme excitement and a lack of inhibition in its host. Anything or anyone that Nihilego latches on to will have its native skills forcibly activated to their fullest extent and will then act as it naturally desires to. Pokémon Adventures also elaborates upon Nihilego's neurotoxin, explaining that its venom turns their negative emotions into happiness and pleasure. It's also said that Nihilego mostly feed on those who feel intense worry or anxiety.\n\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Nihilego stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokémon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. As seen in the games and in The Homecoming Crown!, Nihilego are capable of creating illusions, such as making itself and its allies vanish and are even capable of seeing the memories of humans. That same episode also showed that Nihilego can demonstrate emotions other than self-preservation and the ability to heal people.\n\nNihilego is capable of physically merging with its host, such as with Lusamine in various media. In this \"merged\" state, the Nihilego's bell loses its stars, developing several iridescent spots across its surface. Its eight tentacles become long and flattened and have numerous deep black spots with various colored diamond-shapes inside. Four of the tentacles are connected to the bell via frilly white structures; these tentacles have four spines protruding from them that can be used similarly to hands. The remaining four tentacles each terminate in a single larger spine. Lusamine's body also changes and is visible within Nihilego's bell as her legs dangle beneath it. Her hair turns black with golden lines, her eyes turn yellow, half of her legs and dress become black as the other half becomes purple.\n\nThe toxins produced by Nihilego may remain in the host's body, even after Nihilego has left their body. This can leave the former host to remain ill for unspecified amounts of time and treatment may be necessary. Nihilego leaving a host's body can also cause unconsciousness, as is the case with Lusamine, however it unknown whether or not this is because of Nihilego's toxins, the stress of fusion or the overwhelming amount of Z-Power within her body. As depicted in 10,000,000 Reasons to Fight!, its lower tentacles inject its toxins into the ground while sharp rocks grow below. While the same episode shows that Nihilego can willingly end this merger and it may be disrupted in other ways as well, the lingering toxins and the shock of the separation can leave the host in critical condition, both physically and psychologically. The same episode also shows that Nihilego can take full control of the fusion and form an orb with its own mass to prevent its host from escaping the fusion."

Protruding from under these joints is a long, silver proboscis. It has many bulging muscles that appear to be sacs full of a red fluid with small white bubbles inside. There are three sacs on each arm, two on each leg, two on its chest, and several on its shoulders and down its back. Around its waist are three rings of smaller sacs. The muscles on its chest and some on its arms and waist have thin, grayish lines resembling tendons running across them. It has large, five-fingered hands with red knuckles and four pointed legs.

Its proboscis is said to be harder than a diamond. Buzzwole is powerful enough destroy to a dump truck with a single punch. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Buzzwole's most distinctive feature is its skill to strengthen itself. Buzzwole is able to absorb energy and then achieve a chemical reaction between the energy it has absorbed and its own body fluids. As a result, Buzzwole's body swells to an almost explosive extent. Its muscles bulge and are so thick and dense that they are stronger even than steel. Both its Attack and Defense experience a clear leap in power. It also displays a habit of striking a pose each time that it takes any sort of action, it is thought this might serve as a method of communication, but it is not well understood.\n\nWicke also claims that, like all Ultra Beasts, Buzzwole stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokémon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura."

Pheromosa's speed is believed to be fast enough to dodge lightning. It displays a considerable reluctance towards touching anything as if it interprets the Pokémon world as being unclean somehow. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Pheromosa can reach speeds exceeding 120 mph [200 km/h] in just an instant. This speed is greater than any other living creature that has been discovered to date. But its most distinctive features may in fact be its beauty and its powerful pheromones. Most any creature that squares off against Pheromosa becomes confused, as if struck by the beast’s beauty, and loses the will to fight. It is still a subject of research, but it’s thought that Pheromosa may possess some sort of organ able to produce a pheromonal substance previously unknown to science.\n\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Pheromosa stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokémon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura."

Each smaller stalk has a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk. Its main body is conical and resembles a dress with four overlapping layers. The shortest and outermost layer is the shortest and appears metallic, while the inner layers are each a lighter shade of green, progressively longer, and seem to be cloth or plant material. Underneath all the layers is a white body with a light gray crisscross pattern covering it and a bright blue ring along the base. Below the dress is what appears to be a collection of eight black bamboo stalks. On the bottom of each stalk is a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk; this causes the stalks to also resemble solid rocket boosters. Celesteela is one of the heaviest Pokémon, tying with Cosmoem.\n\nCelesteela live in another world named Ultra Crater. It appears to grow out of the ground like a plant in its homeworld, before exploding the ground around itself, and flying away into space for unknown reasons. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Celesteela's most distinctive feature is the energy that it stores within itself, a flammable gas that it can shoot from its two huge arms. This is mostly used to propel itself in flight and for battle, but it has sufficient power and lift to even fly into space. Its bodily construction closely resembles that of a plant, and it absorbs nutrients from the soil.\n\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Celesteela stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokémon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. Celesteela's rocket thrusters are powerful enough to destroy an entire bamboo forest. As seen in Rise and Shine, Starship!, Celesteela have a long lifespans, as one was buried in Alola, growing for over 200 years."

    "solution": "This is kartana, and is a Grass/Steel-type Pokemon. Kartana (Japanese: カミツルギ Kamiturugi) is a dual-type Grass/Steel Ultra Beast Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.\n\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\n\nIt is code-named UB-04 Blade (Japanese: ＵＢ０４ Ｓｌａｓｈ).\nKartana is a small Ultra Beast that resembles an origami human. It appears to be folded out of a sheet of paper which is white on one side and orange on the other. Its head is folded slightly inside its body and has a four-sided star in the center, but no discernible facial features. Its head opens and closes similar to a paper fortune teller and seems to function as both an eye and a mouth. On top of its head are two short antennae or horns that are wider at the top. It has long, thin arms that resemble katanas with a yellow, sheath-like structure around the upper area. The sheath connects to a red, slightly raised hexagon on its torso. Extending up and out from the base of each sheath are three yellow projections that are nearly as long as its arms. Its legs appear creased with areas of red visible along the edges. Kartana's light, thin build makes it one of the lightest Pokémon in existence.\n\nKartana live in another world named Ultra Forest. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Kartana's most distinctive feature is its thin and razor-sharp body, of which every edge has as cruel a cutting edge as any well-honed blade. The edges on its arms are particularly in a class of their own. Any opponent who tries to attack it will be cut down with a single strike of its blades. Its thin body also allows it to evade attacks by dancing lightly out of the way. This is a very dangerous creature, considering its excellent offensive and defensive capabilities, but due to the nature of its body, it is also highly vulnerable to fire and moisture.\n\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Kartana stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokémon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. In the Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon episode Living on the Cutting Edge!, Kartana can open Ultra Wormholes and has the ability to speak the human language, albeit in reverse."

Guzzlord (Japanese: アクジキング Akuziking) is a dual-type Dark/Dragon Ultra Beast Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.\n\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\n\nIt is code-named UB-05 Glutton (Japanese: ＵＢ０５ Ｇｌｕｔｔｏｎｙ).\nGuzzlord is a massive, black Ultra Beast. Its main body is primarily spherical with a large, yellow mouth in the center. The top and bottom of the mouth are lined with two rows of teeth; the front row is yellow, while the rear row is black. In the second row of the upper jaw, two teeth curve out of the mouth similar to tusks. The inside of its mouth is a bright blue and its throat is lined with small spikes; its large black tongue is also lined with small spikes. Additional tongues resembling long arms with pincers protrude from its lower jaw even when its mouth is closed. Just above its mouth are two glowing, blue eyes with a yellow, diamond-shaped marking between them. Above each eye is a single, bat-like wing with yellow along the upper edge. There are other small bat-like wings down the sides of its body as well. On the underside of its body are three, fin-like projections that curve up towards its mouth. Guzzlord's body is supported by a pair of thick legs, which have yellow zigzag markings across the knees and three claws each. On top of its body is a small, conical head with a second, smaller pair of glowing blue eyes. Four short horns with yellow tips form a ring around its head. On either side of its head is a larger, slightly curved horn also tipped in yellow. There is also a pair of arms on top of its body. Each arm has a hand with three yellow claws. A row of small spikes trails down its back and along its tail. The tail itself extends from the center of its back and resembles a medieval mace.\n\nGuzzlord live in another world known as the Ultra Ruin, which is an alternate universe's Alola, more specifically Hau'oli City. In the Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon episode Battling the Beast Within!, it was revealed that Guzzlord is not native to the Ultra Ruin; it actually got there through an Ultra Wormhole and started devouring everything, leaving a barren wasteland behind. In the same episode, it was revealed that the second face above its maw is Guzzlord's weak point. Its body is said to feel like hard rubber. In order to eat, its tongue moves in a wave-like motion that pulls food towards its mouth. Guzzlord has an astounding appetite, devouring not only objects, but the ground, rivers, and even the seas. There have been reports of it eating mountains and buildings whole. Despite the massive amounts that it consumes, no droppings have been found, which may suggest its digestion is perfect, converting everything into energy in order to sustain itself. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Guzzlord's most distinctive feature is its limitless appetite. It feeds without pause every moment that it is awake. It uses the two large tongues that protrude from its mouth to catch and devour everything in its path, be it organic or inorganic matter. And while it eats such an inordinate amount, Guzzlord excreta has never been discovered. It is thought that it might fully convert the things that it eats into energy for it to use.\n\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Guzzlord stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokémon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura."

    "solution": "This is necrozma, and is a Psychic/Steel/Ghost/Dragon-type Pokemon. Necrozma (Japanese: ネクロズマ Necrozma) is a Psychic-type Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VII.\n\nWhile it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Necrozma has the following three forms:\n\nNecrozma is the game mascot of both Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, appearing on their boxarts as Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma, respectively. Necrozma, Solgaleo, and Lunala are often collectively referred to as the light trio by fans. It is associated with the guardian deities. It is related to the Ultra Beasts, but is not usually considered to be one itself.\nNecrozma is a vaguely humanoid Pokémon whose body appears to be constructed out of a black crystalline material. Necrozma's body is primarily prismatic and black due to the amount of impurities in its system. The large protrusion attached to its head is its tail, which has a row of three large spikes along the top and is white in the back with a dark gray symbol resembling a eight-pointed star in the center. Its face is actually a prism-like object known as the \"brain prism\", which possesses a collection of multicolored shapes that resemble eyes. While absorbing light, this brain prism glows white. Its thin arms have disproportionately large hands with three claws. Jutting out of the back of each hand is a whitish crystal that darkens toward the tip, and each elbow has a hook-like spike. Two large spikes jut from each shoulder and there is a row of smaller spikes along each side of its body. Its feet have three hook-like toes each.\n\nNecrozma originates from Ultra Space and is capable of opening and traveling through Ultra Wormholes. This causes many to believe Necrozma is one of the Ultra Beasts, however, different accounts refer to Necrozma as a \"reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts\" and \"a creature almost like an Ultra Beast\". It once had the ability to give light in its original form, but lost this ability along its true form after being heavily injured by the Ultra Recon Squad's ancestors in an attempt to steal its light; Professor Kukui and Lillie theorize that the Sparkling Stones and the Z-Crystals used to perform Z-Moves are fragments of Necrozma's body that it lost upon being injured and rained down into Alola. According to the Ultra Recon Squad, the light that radiates from Necrozma is the aura that surrounds the Trainer and Pokémon while performing a Z-Move and the aura surrounding a Totem Pokémon. This energy is consumed by Pokémon such as the Ultra Beasts and radiated by Pokémon such as Solgaleo and Lunala.\n\nNecrozma displays extremely violent behavior due to the constant, maddening pain it suffers in its incomplete state. Desperate for the light it requires to sustain itself and regain its original form, Necrozma steals light from other beings and places. This behavior caused it to be feared as and known as a \"pillager of light\" in ancient times. Its black coloration is a result of impurities building up within it as a result of its deep slumber. Necrozma can shoot powerful lasers using the power of a prism. These lasers are powerful enough to blast through anything it hits. It can also attack its foes with a large pillar of light. Using its tail, it is able to propel itself by shooting black light from it. When Necrozma absorbs light from a world, that world becomes shrouded in darkness until the stolen light is returned as seen temporarily in Alola and in Ultra Megalopolis. In Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon, the Aether Foundation confused Necrozma for an Ultra Beast and gave it a code name, \"UB: Black\". As seen in Filling the Light with Darkness, Necrozma is capable of absorbing a world's Ultra Aura, which causes adults to become more tired and lose motivation. Necrozma loves Necrozma Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered and roared loudly to intimidate it in the past.\n\nNecrozma is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Prismatic Laser and Photon Geyser. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Prism Armor as an Ability."

Its head is a medium-sized sphere with a slight point in the back. Around Magearna's head is a gear with seven teeth, although the gear does not cover its chin. It has two large, rabbit-like ears with gold rims; a tiny nose and mouth; and light red eyes with pinkish ovals in the center. In the centers of the ovals are white crosses, and thin gold wiring encircles each eye with two small prongs similar to eyelashes. The rabbit-like ears appear to be two halves of a large disc held together by a hinge at the top. In the center of Magearna's body, there lies an orb-shaped object called the \"Soul-Heart\", which is Magearna's true self. The Soul-Heart is mostly light blue, but is divided by a thick gray band, and in the front center of the band lies a circular depression that is half-blue and half-pink. Above and below the depression, in the light blue portions, is a yellow, diamond-shaped marking. On either side of its upper body is a large, spherical shoulder with thin upper arms that lead to large, claw-shaped forearms and slightly pointed hands. Its lower body is a much larger sphere that resembles a ball gown. There is a pair of golden, wavy lines on each side of this sphere, which is divided down the front and back by a gray line. In the back, there is a solid gold ring with a hole in the center at the bottom of this line. The front has a gold ring as well, but it is broken at the top and bottom and has a shield shape in the center. Metal plates similar to the ruffles of a dress adorn the bottom of its lower body. It has two pointed legs.\n\nMagearna was created by a scientist as a gift to royalty, specifically to a king's daughter 500 years ago. The Soul-Heart in its chest is an artificial soul that was created by the scientist by collecting life energy from other Pokémon. Due to Magearna's ability to feel other's pain, it will try as hard as it can to save injured Pokémon. It can even perceive the emotions, thoughts, or feelings of other Pokémon as well. When it falls asleep or when it is sad, Magearna can take on the appearance of a Poké Ball.\n\nMagearna is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Fleur Cannon. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Soul-Heart as an Ability."

Its eyes are orange-red with yellow pupils, and above each eye is a yellow, oval marking. Each arm has a small bump on the wrist. Around its neck is a smoky collar, and there is a trail of shadows on each foot.\n\nWhen angered or attacking, Marshadow's fighting spirit will begin to burn, turning it into Zenith Marshadow. In this state, its headgear, wrist bumps, and collar flare up and resemble green and yellow flames. Marshadow's eyes also flare up when in this state, but do not change in color.\n\nVery few people have seen it, being left undiscovered for a long time so its existence has been the stuff of legends and myths. Marshadow is a cautious Pokémon and can sink into the shadows to ensure it is not noticed, similarly to Gengar. While hiding in the shadows of others, it can understand their feelings and even copy their abilities. Through mimicry, it will eventually become more powerful than those it imitates. It can even learn the ultimate technique of martial arts masters it copies. As seen in the movie I Choose You!, Marshadow is also capable of causing nightmares. In the same movie, Marshadow can also shapeshift and stretch out its arms. While corrupted by the Rainbow Feather, it can even take control of countless Pokémon with the power of its shadows.\n\nMarshadow is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Spectral Thief.

It has a bipedal build with a large head and relatively small limbs with no visible digits. On its head are three spikes: one in the front and one on each side. A single gray needle protrudes from the top of its head and there are additional needles in the spikes on the sides of its head. It has oval eyes with a single eyelash-like spike above each; its mouth and eyes give off a cyan glow. It has a long, tapering tail with a single spine in the middle. While most of its body is dark purple, it has several fuchsia markings: at the tip of each head-spike, on its chest, on top of its head, and on its face.\n\nIn the games, Poipole originates from Ultra Megalopolis in Ultra Space, where it is popular as a first partner Pokémon. However, Poipole originates from an unnamed world in Pokémon the Series. It is capable of understanding human speech after spending enough time with humans. Poipole's large head is filled with a glowing, adhesive poison, which it can fire from the needles on its head. While spraying opponents with this venom, it laughs wildly. As seen in the animated series, Poipole can also shoot a harmless multicolored substance as a way to paint, which can be also used to communicate with humans and Pokémon. It is shown to have the habit to stand upside down and spin rapidly as a sign of happiness and excitement. Like all Ultra Beasts, Poipole stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokémon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. In The Shape of Love to Come!, it is revealed that wild Poipole live in large numbers in huge nests that resemble wasp or hornet nests alongside Naganadel, who serves as a leader."

Its upper body is slender with thin arms and a long neck. The upper chest, neck, head, and arms are light purple, while its waist is dark purple with a fuchsia stripe on each side. Each shoulder has a long gray spike, and each hand has three pinkish-purple claws. Running down each side of its neck is a dark purple stripe, which connects and forms a loop on its chest. The lower area of the loop is fuchsia and has a short, downward extension in the middle. At the end of its long neck is its head, which has a long, spiked crest on the top. On the sides of its mouth are a pair of curved, gray spikes that act as mandibles. Its glowing cyan eyes are conjoined, rimmed with fuchsia, and have a spiky crest on either side, which gives them a visor-like appearance.

The stones that form the legs and the top corners are slightly darker. When at rest, its legs fit into the corners of the structure. Its lighter gray stones have glowing blue lines on their sides, which are visible along its edges and underside. Each stone square has a black underside with a circular, glowing blue eye in the center. These eyes will turn red whenever angered or fighting.\n\nAccording to Phyco, a single Stakataka comprises almost 150 individual brick-like lifeforms.

It lacks an electricity-generating organ, so it gathers and stores electricity from outside sources. This Pokémon can create a very powerful magnetic field through the strong electric currents emitted from its paw pads. Using this magnetic field allows it to levitate and move at high speeds while airborne. Zeraora can travel as fast as a lightning strike. Its fur is known to stand on end whenever it is using massive amounts of electricity. Zeraora can tear its opponents apart with its high-voltage claws. Even if the opponent dodges, they can still get electrocuted by the flying sparks. Lightning flashes and thunderclaps can occur when Zeraora starts running.\n\nZeraora is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Plasma Fists."

A large, golden hexagonal nut encircles its neck and a smaller one acts as its head. Floating in its head is a small, dark gray sphere which may be oscillated. It has a small red tail resembling an electrical wire.\n\nAccording to Professor Willow, Melmetal lived in a secluded area deep within a wooded land that was full of sedimentary rocks rich with magnetite, and its shed metal was used by ancient people to create unique metal tools. The process of evolution has hardened its body, making it incredibly sturdy. However, it is still in a liquid state and has some flexibility, particularly in its heavy hex nut arms. Melmetal applies centrifugal force on its arms, allowing it to have the strongest punches of all Pokémon. When it attacks, the nuts encircling its arms slide down as if to bulk up its fists. It is said to be created when one strong Meltan absorbs the group it lives with in order to evolve. When it reaches the end of its life, it will rust and break down into small shards, from which new Meltan will be born. In ancient times, Melmetal was worshiped for its ability to create metal from nothing. After its death 3,000 years ago, its worshippers placed the Meltan born from it inside Mystery Boxes as a way for Melmetal to return in the future.\n\nMelmetal is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Double Iron Bash."

Each of its hands has five fingers, while each of its feet has three toes. It has two large white eyes with black irises. A lime green mask pattern frames its eyes, and extends towards its forehead in a small bump above its snout.\n\nGrookey has two, leaf-shaped hair tufts that hold a stick on the top of its head. The stick used to be a branch from a forest where troops of Grookey lived, and it has a special power due to being exposed to the energy within Grookey's body. This energy helps Grookey's stick grow harder and more flexible. Besides using it when attacking, Grookey beats this stick rhythmically against the surfaces of all sorts of objects. This has been observed to cause grass to grow, and wilted flowers and leaves to seemingly regain their color. As depicted in the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode Beyond Chivalry… Aiming to be a Leek Master!, it can even restore weakened plant-like Pokémon such as Bellsprout. Grookey's green fur can create energy from the sunlight, similar to how plants use their green leaves to photosynthesize. Grookey is said to be full of boundless curiosity. It enjoys being in high places, and rhythmic things such as music or dancing. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy.\n\nIn Generation IX, Grookey and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Grassy Surge as an Ability."

Its ears, arms, and tail are dark brown, and its two large eyes are yellow in color. It has dark green bands around its wrists and the stick it holds splits in two after its evolution, which it uses to hold up a tuft of leaves resembling hair on its head. When it removes the sticks, the leaves resemble a mohawk, with a dark green color on the ends. It has several sharp teeth.\n\nThwackey can use its two sticks to create a rhythmic beat. The faster a rhythm Thwackey creates, the more respect it earns from its peers. Often, when it drums out rapid beats in battle, Thwackey will get so caught up in the rhythm that it does not realize its opponent has been knocked out. This action will also cause Thwackey to even ignore its own Trainer’s commands. To further develop its sense of rhythm, it constantly uses it in daily life. It can always feel a beat, and it walks while swaying back and forth to this beat, along with drumming with its sticks. As seen in the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode A One-Stick Wonder!, Thwackey can groom its friends to cheer them up; this is its way to show friendship and trust.\n\nIn Generation IX, Thwackey and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokémon that can have Grassy Surge as an Ability."

The roots of the stump follow the direction of its drumming in battle. In a troop of Rillaboom, the one with the best drumming technique is the leader. This is how Rillaboom who challenged each other for leadership usually settles it through a drum battle. Rillaboom has a kind and calm disposition, valuing harmony within its group. It is very sensitive towards discord that could threaten the group's harmony, so it keeps a strict watch for such actions. Any offenders who drum up discord will be strictly disciplined by Rillaboom until they have learned their lesson. Due to its strong sense of unity, it will ferociously defend its allies from trouble.\n\nRillaboom is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Drum Beating. Additionally, in Generation IX, Rillaboom and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pokémon that can have Grassy Surge as an Ability."

However, it is also rather unintelligent, forgetful, and bad at learning, as the energy used by its brain is minimal. It tends to focus more on battling, but sometimes it can't remember what it is battling mid-fight. Despite this forgetfulness, Cramorant never forgets Trainers that it trusts. However, it will try to attack its Trainer if they try to steal its food.\n\nCramorant is the only known Pokémon that can have Gulp Missile as its Ability."

Cursola are known to gather together under a full moon, and send their branches into the sky. The reason for this behavior is unknown — one hypothesis suggests that it is a ritual of release, shedding the energy they've gathered from others; while another hypothesis posits that this is a form of communication between the Cursola.\n\nCursola is the only known Pokémon that can have Perish Body as an Ability."

It is a poor swimmer, and is often seen aimlessly floating in the ocean with just its ice-covered head floating on the surface, occasionally washing up on distant shores. It never panics or gets upset whenever it ends up in a new land, instead continuing due to its ability to adapt. The ice on Eiscue's head has a mild salty taste, presumed to be caused by it having floated in the oceans. When the weather is hot, groups of Eiscue will cool each other down by pressing their ice cube heads together.

Its form also changes the type of its signature move, Aura Wheel.\nMorpeko is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon who can change forms via its signature Hunger Switch Ability, which alters its appearance. The features shared between the two forms are short, stubby arms and feet; a pair of pink circular cheek pouches; a very tiny nose; two almond-shaped ears with a single fur tuft under each; and a primary body color separating two areas of fur which cover the arms, ears, cheeks, and eyes, and zigzag inward towards its face, stopping at the waistline. These fur patches form pockets that it can store seeds in. On the back of its body is a pattern resembling a Pikachu's tail that extends from the bottom half of its fur.

By experiencing prolonged hunger, the hormones in Morpeko shift in balance, and its fur color changes. As a result of intense hunger, Morpeko becomes aggressive, driven into committing all kinds of evil deeds and enacting extreme violence until their hunger is satisfied. The energy within its cheeks also changes from Electric-type to Dark-type. Hangry Mode Morpeko has a wild, brute-like nature while in this form. However, as seen in the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode Crowning the Chow Crusher!, once Morpeko is fully fed, it will refuse to eat more food and attack anyone who tries to feed it.\n\nMorpeko is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Aura Wheel."

Dracovish allegedly went extinct due to overhunting its prey, though this is likely not the case due to it being combined from two separate Pokémon that each had their niches before going extinct. As seen in the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode On Land, In the Sea, and to the Future!, Dracovish can run very fast when underwater. It has also been shown that Dracovish can awaken a dormant power from within itself that causes the spikes on its chest to become surrounded by a red aura. When in this state, the spikes can be used to bind targets or jab them."

Its body is mainly light gray and dark blue, with zigzag patterns running down its body, gray bands around its arms, and two black slits on its lower chest. Its hands have four triangular indents. Duraludon's head has a small red section and multiple slits on it. It also has yellow eyes with green pupils, and it appears to be permanently scowling. It moves its upper jaw when opening its mouth.

Weighing only 88 lbs. (40 kg), it can move very fast. However, its body can easily rust, so it lives in caves and mountainous areas and avoids rain. The metal body also has a risk of overheating, so it vents the heat out through the slits inside its tail. It uses its arms, which have slightly different shapes from each other, to grind down rock surfaces for food. Duraludon has a rivalry with Tyranitar, which it shares its habitat with, and they often battle each other in the mountains of Galar. It mainly resides in caves and mountains within cold areas.\n\nDuraludon and its evolved form, Archaludon, are the only known Pokémon that can have Stalwart as an Ability."

Dragapult carries a pair of Dreepy inside its horns, which it will fire at its opponents like supersonic missiles during battle. It's said that the Dreepy it carries greatly enjoy being sent flying toward opponents at immense speeds. This is evident by the fact that Dreepy always gather around the fastest Dragapult in their group. By focusing its mind, Dragapult can also turn itself, as well as the Dreepy inside its horns, invisible.

    "solution": "This is eternatus, and is a Poison/Dragon-type Pokemon. Eternatus (Japanese: ムゲンダイナ Mugendina) is a dual-type Poison/Dragon Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.\n\nWhile it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, the player battles a powered-up form of Eternatus known as Eternamax Eternatus in the climax of Pokémon Sword and Shield. Prior to Generation IX, this form could also briefly be seen when it uses its signature move, Eternabeam, but the form itself cannot be acquired legitimately in-game.\n\nIt is associated with the legendary heroes and was responsible for the Darkest Day.\nEternatus is a gigantic, draconic alien Pokémon. Its body has a vaguely draconic shape and skeletal appearance, and it is largely dark violet with red highlights. Its main body and tail are long and thin and resemble a spinal column, and it has four small, thin limbs ending in claws formed from spindly appendages attached at right angles. Its torso is formed from a cage of appendages resembling ribs, and inside is a glowing pink core that serves as Eternatus's energy source, absorbing energy to sustain it. Its head is triangular and has a pair of white, eye-like markings in the form of three connected circles, as well as a spindly lower jaw with several diamond-shaped teeth. Over its head is a translucent red film held between five long spikes extending toward its body's rear. It also has a pair of thin tendrils extending from its back, formed from numerous triangular segments. Eternatus's gigantic size makes it the tallest known Pokémon with the exception of Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon.\n\nEternatus serves as the source of the Dynamax phenomenon in Galar due to its power leaking out in the form of Galar particles following its defeat 3000 years ago by Zacian, Zamazenta, and two human youths. After it reawakened in the present day, Eternatus's core needed to reabsorb the Galar particles in order to remain active, apparently due to its past defeat weakening it. In Pokémon Masters EX, Eternatus can replace Galar particles by absorbing sync stone energy in massive amounts instead. Its core can also project its absorbed energy into massive blasts fired directly from its center. These blasts are capable of causing more damage to Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon. Pieces of its body imbued with its power rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars. When it is awake, Eternatus causes a phenomenon dubbed the Darkest Day, in which the massive quantities of Dynamax energy it unleashes cause Pokémon to Dynamax and rampage uncontrollably. It can also sometimes keep other Pokémon from Dynamaxing in its presence. Despite this connection to the phenomenon, it cannot Dynamax itself, as its Eternamax form replaces that effect.\n\nAs depicted in the Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode Sword and Shield: \"From Here to Eternatus!\", Eternatus can use its energy core to target a Pokémon and force it to Dynamax or Gigantamax. The series also elaborates upon its ability to block other Pokémon from Dynamaxing, depicting this power as Eternatus absorbing the Galar particles in the area to make them unavailable for other Pokémon to use. The same episode also shows that Eternatus can forcibly revert other Pokémon that have already Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed through the same process. In the animated series, Rose coined Eternatus's name, but in the past, it was known as the \"Darkest Day\", as referred to by the people of Galar who feared it 3000 years ago.\n\nAs seen in chapter Oh My!! The Disappearance of Henry of the Pokémon Adventures manga, Eternatus's poison has the capability of altering people's behavior, making them violent and selfish, as shown with Henry after he touched the poison. As later mentioned by Calyrex in PASS38, both met during the first Darkest Day.\n\nEternatus is an extraterrestrial Pokémon that came to the Pokémon world inside an asteroid around 20,000 years ago. It's implied by Peonia that Eternatus's asteroid (referred to as a Wishing Star) landed at the Crown Tundra, specifically in Slippery Slope, creating a cavern called the Max Lair.\n\nEternatus is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Dynamax Cannon and Eternabeam."

Wild Kubfu live in mountainous areas far away from the Galar region, although they lived in the region at some point. According to historical texts, Kubfu used to travel to uncharted lands with people as they went to trade or explore. Records suggest that the Kubfu living in faraway mountains in the present day, may have descended from the Kubfu that became naturalized in the distant lands they visited in the past. It has been referred to as the \"secret armor\" of the Isle of Armor's Master Dojo, being gifted by Mustard to the one who pass the dojo's three trials. The move it masters by reading one of the special scrolls in one of the Towers of Two Fists will determine which fighting style it takes after evolving. While it can be timid, it can become more brave and confident once trained up. Kubfu loves Kubfu Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered and trained with it in the past."

Its left eye is closed with thick, mauve-colored eyelashes. It has a wavy purple mane that transitions into mauve towards the tips, with the tips themselves being translucent. Its fringe and tail are completely mauve. It has slender legs marked with a purple sock pattern. Each of its purple hooves is detached from its legs at the pastern, and the rear pair of the hooves are trailed by spectral mist.\n\nAs Spectrier desires isolation and silence, it tends to be active during the night where its energy is heightened. Its nocturnal habits resulted in it having weak eyesight, but its other four senses are keenly sharpened; this allows Spectrier to have an accurate sense of the terrain and location of living things. Its kicks are said to separate a soul from its body, and it can steal the life force of sleeping beings. It feeds on the ambient life-force it steals from others and will attack anyone who would try to disturb it.\n\nSpectrier is known to be very proud and arrogant, preferring to serve individuals it deems the strongest. It once ruled over the Crown Tundra, lording over all the other Pokémon living there and terrorizing humans who intrude on its territory. This lasted until it was defeated and tamed by Calyrex using the Reins of Unity. Spectrier has a fondness for carrots, particularly Shaderoot Carrots. It also loves Spectrier Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.\n\nWhen fused with Calyrex, Spectrier's speed becomes swift to the point it can run a thousand miles within a single day. The strength of Spectrier's spectral power also increases. By Shadow Rider Calyrex's psychic influence, Spectrier can create countless small will-o'-the-wisps. These wisps have the power to steal the opponent's life-force with burning heat. Calyrex can also transform the steed's spectral aura into a black mass. This mass is powerful enough to absorb the life-force and souls of any being's energy like a black hole.\n\nSpectrier is the only known Pokémon that can have Grim Neigh as its Ability."

One fairy tale even mentions Calyrex stealing the body of a human that causes mischief.\n\nCalyrex is known as the \"King of Bountiful Harvests\" by Crown Tundra's inhabitants due to its role in bringing lush vegetation and harvests yearly. Calyrex's right hand can cause the land to be covered in verdant grass and blooms, while its left hand allows it to make fields of fruit ripen and become heavy. Calyrex can grow either Iceroot or Shaderoot Carrots, depending on the field where Carrot Seeds are planted on, with a special dance. Calyrex can also create the Radiant Petal needed for the Reins of Unity and with enough energy, even a complete flower. It can provide healings or blessings such as mending the heart. While it shows no mercy to those that stand in its way, it will heal the wounds of a foe afterwards. Calyrex is powerful enough to move an entire forest and its Pokémon to a new location.

A wreath of solid orange-and-yellow fire energy emerges from the back of Skeledirge's jaws, which circles around its head.\n\nThere is an orange fiery bird resting on top of Skeledirge's head, which is a separate, independent entity from the Pokémon. This bird is spherical, with a yellow face, white eyes, a short crest and tail, and a singular tiny pointed \"foot\" it balances itself on. It is said that the bird was born when the egg-shaped fireball Skeledirge had as a Crocalor gained a soul, which also gave Skeledirge its Ghost typing. The bird can sometimes be seen pecking at Skeledirge's jaws, supposedly cleaning its teeth.\n\nAs shown in Pokémon Sleep, Skeledirge and its pre-Evolutions are known to sometimes sleep with one eye open. The fiery bird on Skeledirge's head sometimes moves about and even plays pranks on it when Skeledirge's sleep is shallow, a behavior which Skeledirge tolerates.\n\nSkeledirge has a meddlesome but caring personality. Its singing is gentle, but powerful and full of vitality, capable of soothing the souls of all who hears it. Opponents hearing its singing will feel warm and fulfilled inside, losing their will to battle. Skeledirge burns its enemies by unleashing flames that exceed the temperature of 5,400 °F (3,000 °C). When Skeledirge sings, its fire bird transforms into a microphone for Skeledirge, growing its \"foot\" longer until it reaches the ground. The bird is then powered up by the Skeledirge's singing, growing larger, and flying towards its enemy.\n\nSkeledirge is the only known Pokémon capable of learning Torch Song."

They were also the first Generation IX Pokémon to be revealed to the public on February 27, 2022, through a Pokémon Presents video presentation.\nQuaxly is a white duckling-like Pokémon. It has a yellow beak and blue eyes. It has teal webbed feet and a large teal coif-like crest that covers its head, with a feathery tuft in the front and a white curvy line shaped like a wave. Quaxly's coif has a smooth feel thanks to the rich, moist cream that holds it. The cream it secretes can repel grime. The coif can become unkempt should it get dry.\n\nQuaxly is an earnest and tidy Pokémon, and tends to overthink things. Quaxly's feathers secrete a glossy gel which protects its body against water and grime. It hates getting itself dirty, especially on its head. Quaxly's strong legs allow it to swim without issues, even in strong currents. It also uses its legs to repeatedly kick its foes with swift speed. Although found in Paldea, Quaxly is not native to the region, instead having migrated from faraway places a long time ago. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, the coif on its head grows dry and messy should Quaxly sleep for a very long time. However, this tend to happen on extremely rare occasions."

Its face has blue eyes, a pointed yellow beak, and a teal brow just above it which flares into two large branches flanking a small bump in the middle. On top of Quaxwell's head is a round blue crest twice as large, which droops towards the back. Various blue and teal-colored feathers also adorn its chest, forearms, tail, and the insides of its feet. The three feathers at the end of its arms are similar to fingers. Quaxwell's legs are long and its feet are yellow with three toes each, and they wrap around its ankles in a manner that resembles ballet shoes.\n\nThe crest above Quaxwell's head is capable of absorbing impacts, and is used by Quaxwell to shield itself from incoming attacks. Doing this may mess up the crest, however, which causes its body and mind to feel unwell and weakened. If its crest becomes unkempt and messy, it will quickly use gel to comb it back into shape.\n\nQuaxwell has a serious, stoic personality, though it is also known to be temperamental. It learns and practices dance routines by observing the movements of people and Pokémon from various regions. Quaxwell is a hard worker, and constantly trains its strength and technique. Flocks of Quaxwell train by running their legs through shallow waters, and then compete with each other for the most graceful kicks. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Quaxwell maintains its beautiful posture. However, the daily training it maintains can occasionally leave it too tired to care for its coif. As a result, the coif is usually left messy as it sleeps."

Lechonk has a timid and faint-hearted temperament, and will panic and charge forward if attacked or startled by an opponent. Despite its apparent bulk, Lechonk's body mainly consists not of fat but of muscle, built up by its habit of walking around to find food. Some Trainers use Lechonk to look for cooking ingredients, such as detached Crabominable pincers scattered on mountains. As seen in the Pokémon Horizons: The Series episode Welcome to Paldea!, Lechonk will become hostile towards trainers carrying groceries or meals and attack them for their food."

It has tan legs with feet shaped in a zygodactyl arrangement; i.e. two toes each on the front and back. Each toe is tipped with a yellow claw. Squawkabilly has a rounded, lumpy black crest on its head that resembles a pompadour, and white feathers on its eyelids, face, belly, and the tips of its wings. The rest of its feathers have different colorations depending on the form, which come in green, blue, yellow, and off-white. The feathers around the bottom of its body are notably longer, giving the appearance of a long coat.\n\nSquawkabilly are known to be exceptionally noisy. They have a strong sense of community and dislike being alone, so they cooperate and form flocks that can contain more than fifty individuals based on the color of their feathers. In the mornings and evenings, they search for food in forests, towns, and cities; the latter is their preferred habitat, where they fight with other Squawkabilly of different plumes over territory. Green Plumage Squawkabilly make up the largest, most powerful groups, and are viewed by their Blue Plumage counterparts as rivals. Yellow Plumage Squawkabilly are especially fierce, engaging in vicious close combat and driving other bird Pokémon out of towns. White Plumage Squawkabilly have the fewest population numbers, although they are still able to hold territory because their feathers help them camouflage against the white buildings of cities. Squawkabilly once had violent territorial disputes with Fletchling, who inhabit the same rural and urban areas.\n\nIn Paldea, Squawkabilly is used for the region's Flying Taxi service. Certain Squawkabilly, such as the one found in Medali in the core series games, and Diana's in the animated series, are shown to be capable of mimicking human speech."

Glimmet is capable of floating to travel. To defend itself from foes, Glimmet scatters poisonous powder from its petals. It may have a connection to the Terastal phenomenon, though this is not confirmed; its Evolution's petals resemble the Tera Jewels that are seen when a Pokémon Terastallizes, many Glimmet (along with its Evolution) can also be found in Area Zero and the Area Zero Underdepths, the place where the Terastal phenomenon originated, and eight Glimmet Crystals are needed to make TM171 (Tera Blast), a move that changes type with Terastallizing. Glimmet has also been seen at Kitakami, specifically the Crystal Pool, where there are Terastal crystals at the bottom of the lake. In Pokémon Horizons: The Series, it is revealed that Glimmet can propel itself faster through the air by spinning its petals like a propeller. It can also separate its body from its head to use as a projectile but this causes it to faint.\n\nGlimmet and its evolved form, Glimmora, are the only known Pokémon that can have Toxic Debris as an Ability."

Koraidon (Japanese: コライドン Koraidon) is a dual-type Fighting/Dragon Legendary Paradox Pokémon introduced in Generation IX.\n\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\n\nIt is said to be either an ancient relative of Cyclizar or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline. It also has a futuristic variant, Miraidon.\n\nKoraidon is the game mascot of Pokémon Scarlet, appearing on the game's box art in its Apex Build. It is also known as the \"Winged King\" (Japanese: ツバサノオウ Tsubasano'ou). Along with Miraidon, it is considered part of the Paradox duo by fans.\nKoraidon is a large, reptilian Pokémon primarily covered in scarlet feathers with white accents on its cheeks, upper body, thighs, and tail. Its most notable feature is a tire-like gular sac on its throat, which inflates and deflates depending on its form. Koraidon's head has a crest of feathers and a pair of long, twisted, brow-plume-like tendrils. Additional feathers at the base of its tail transition from blue to purple and end in white tips, creating a striking appearance. Its eyes have yellow sclerae, orange irises, and brown pupils, with red plumes giving the impression of eyebrows. Koraidon's body is adorned with blue markings on its elbows and shoulders, as well as blue frills down its neck. From each shoulder, a curved, handlebar-like structure extends backward. It has webbed feet, each with four claws; the two central claws are sometimes held close together, making it appear as though there are only three. The gular sac and base of its tail share a grooved texture, but the sac is also lined with spikes.\n\nAware of its formidable strength, Koraidon exudes confidence and rarely feels threatened. Though cautious around humans, its curiosity sometimes leads it to play with them. Its power surges under harsh sunlight due to an ancient energy coursing through its body. In battle, Koraidon will shift into its Gliding Build to crash into its targets with explosive force. While Koraidon bears a resemblance to modern-day Cyclizar, it is known to be far more ferocious and muscular.\n\nThe origins of Koraidon in the present day trace back to a time machine constructed by Professor Sada, which brought two specimens to Area Zero a decade ago. These two individuals displayed contrasting temperaments: one was friendly and curious, while the other was aggressive and territorial. According to AI Sada, it is an ancient Pokémon related to Cyclizar. However, a version of Professor Sada that appeared at the Crystal Pool suggests that Koraidon is a counterpart to Cyclizar from an alternate timeline. It was referred to as the \"Winged King\" in the Scarlet Book, with its current name coined by Professor Sada, potentially as a result of a bootstrap paradox.\n\nKoraidon has five different transformations it can change between as it traverses varying terrain and adapts to different situations. In its Apex Build, Koraidon shifts to a bipedal stance and adopts a poised, battle-ready posture. The feathers on its head and rear unfold and stand upright, forming a crest that resembles a war bonnet. The gular sac on its throat inflates, displaying a red, gear-like pattern, while the base of its tail becomes more robust. Koraidon's claws spread apart, revealing the white membranes between its toes. During battle, Koraidon leverages its immense strength and array of natural weapons to overpower opponents, including powerful jaws, sharp claws, and a sturdy tail. Its legs possess extraordinary strength, allowing it to leap over 65 feet into the air and use the momentum from its falls for devastating kicks and body slams. It is said to have the power to shatter the ground with its fists alone. According to Arven, this is Koraidon's true form. In its Limited Build, Koraidon reverts to a quadrupedal stance. The feathers on its head and rear are folded and closed, and the gular sac retracts, exposing a tire-like protrusion. The webbing between its claws is not visible, as its central claws stay close together. Koraidon typically takes on this form when weakened or not engaged in battle. In all travel forms, Koraidon's tail stays tucked in, displaying a pattern similar to that found on its gular sac. In its Sprinting Build, Koraidon tucks its tail and runs on all fours, allowing it to reach high speeds and climb steep cliffs. In its Swimming Build, the gular sac inflates, enabling Koraidon to float on water. It propels itself by paddling with its webbed feet. In its Gliding Build: The tendrils on Koraidon's head unfurl into wing-like structures, allowing it to glide or fly through the sky.\n\nKoraidon is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Collision Course. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Orichalcum Pulse as an Ability."

It also has an ancient variant, Koraidon.\n\nMiraidon is the game mascot of Pokémon Violet, appearing on the game's box art in its Ultimate Mode. It is also known as the \"Iron Serpent\" (Japanese: テツノオロチ Tetsuno'orochi). Along with Koraidon, it is considered part of the Paradox duo by fans.\nMiraidon is a large, robotic, reptilian Pokémon with a primarily metallic, violet body. Its face, neck, abdomen, tail, and knee joints are silver, while its claws are white. A distinctive feature of Miraidon is the gular sac on its throat, which changes appearance across its various forms. Its head features a small, dark purple casque reminiscent of a motorcycle windshield and circular, purple cheek markings. Miraidon's eyes resemble an LED display, with black sclerae and pupils and pixelated irises that can change pattern to simulate blinking. Each eye is bordered by two connected silver plates that resemble eyelids, from which long blue and yellow plasma-like antennae extend, resembling eyebrows. Miraidon's shoulders are equipped with backward-curving, handlebar-like structures. A black, fender-like structure is positioned on its lower back just above the base of its tail. Each of Miraidon's feet has three claws, with the central one marked by a vertical black line. Both its tail and gular sac have grooved surfaces, resembling tire treads. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Miraidon is shown to possess a robotic tongue that visually resembles its gular sac.\n\nDespite its mechanical appearance, Miraidon displays behavior that suggests an advanced level of intelligence and perceptiveness. It carefully evaluates a person's character using keen insight before deciding to accompany them. Miraidon's calm and enigmatic nature makes it difficult to discern its thoughts or emotions, with subtle hints only visible in its eyes. Miraidon also exhibits biological traits such as the ability to consume food, specifically Herba Mystica sandwiches, to regain strength and power, allowing it to access its transformations after being weakened. Due to the smell of Herba Mystica smell on them, Miraidon can track down Titan Pokémon.\n\nMiraidon can achieve high speeds and unleash powerful, electrically charged attacks, utilizing the advanced engine within its body to amplify its abilities, especially when surrounded by Electric Terrain. In battle, Miraidon can also race at ultrafast speeds to pierce its targets with futuristic electricity. It shares similarities with Cyclizar, a contemporary Pokémon, though Miraidon is notably more powerful and aggressive.\n\nThe origins of Miraidon in the present day trace back to a time machine constructed by Professor Turo, which brought two specimens to Area Zero a decade ago. These two individuals displayed contrasting temperaments: one was friendly and curious, while the other was aggressive and territorial. According to AI Turo, it is a futuristic relative of Cyclizar, though a version of Turo that appeared at the Crystal Pool suggests it may come from an alternate timeline. It was referred to as the \"Iron Serpent\" in the Violet Book, with its current name, Miraidon, attributed to Professor Turo, potentially due to a bootstrap paradox.\n\nMiraidon has five different transformations it can change between as it traverses varying terrain and adapts to different situations. In Ultimate Mode, Miraidon's body becomes charged with purplish-yellow energy. Its gular sac inflates and glows with a bluish-white light, while its antennae flare with electricity, taking on the appearance of lightning bolts. The middle and tip of its tail also emit this energy. Miraidon's back legs fold into its thighs, forming jet engine-like structures that enable it to hover and fly. Its legs also double as electrical cannons in this form. Its irises display a unique combination of light blue outer rings and yellow inner rings. Areas on its cheeks, arms, handlebars, and thighs are filled with light purple energy. When Miraidon enters sleep, it deactivates, causing its glowing features to turn silver. In battle, Miraidon floats to maintain a strategic position, applying pressure to grounded foes while predicting their movements and striking at their weak points. It uses electricity generated within its body to charge its claws, fangs, and tail, with one strike from its charged tail said to knock out even the most resilient opponents. Miraidon can unleash lightning from its mouth, neck, or hind legs, powerful enough to scorch the land. According to Arven, this is considered Miraidon's true form. In Low-Power Mode, Miraidon adopts a quadrupedal stance. It lacks the intense purplish-yellow energy seen in Ultimate Mode, resulting in a monochromatic silver appearance on its gular sac, antennae, and tail similar to when entering sleep in that transformation. Its irises remain light blue, and areas on its cheeks, antennae, handlebars, and thighs retain subtle light purple energy. Miraidon assumes this form when weakened or not engaged in battle. In all travel forms, Miraidon's tail stays tucked in, and its back legs remain folded, exposing its jet engines for propulsion. In Drive Mode, energy is channeled to its tail and throat, creating wheel-like rings that enable high-speed movement and cliff climbing. In Aquatic Mode, the rings expand to help Miraidon float and propel itself in water, using either the rotation of the rings or its jet engines. In Glide Mode, its antennae extend to spread an energy membrane, allowing it to glide or fly through the air.\n\nMiraidon is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Electro Drift. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Hadron Engine as an Ability."

The tea caddy is primarily black and white, with a white lid, a sealed crack near the top, and a painted pattern resembling a face (and functioning as one, being able to change to express emotions). Poltchageist is always seen carrying a 茶杓 chashaku, the tea scoop used to transfer tea powder into the tea bowl in the aforementioned tea ceremony.\n\nPoltchageist heavily resembles Sinistea, although they are not biologically related. On top of its matcha body, just below its lid, is a yellow swirl pattern similar to the one found on Sinistea. On Sinistea, this swirl pattern serves as its weak spot and will cause it to become dizzy if stirred; however, this is not the case for Poltchageist.\n\nAccording to an old tale, Poltchageist was born from the regrets of an old tea master, who was so obsessed with perfecting the art of the tea ceremony that he drove away everyone around him. Poltchageist is more active at night than during the day, prowling around towns and their outskirts. By day, Poltchageist dwells in cool, dark places — usually in old houses, which is its favorite.\n\nPoltchageist tends to scatter its matcha powder on people and food. If someone touches or ingests the powder, they will notice their skin apparently glowing for a brief moment, before they fall unconscious as their life force is sapped away by the powder for Poltchageist to use as energy. It is capable of draining energy in this way from many people at once. Another behavior exhibited by Poltchageist is its strong tendency to repair broken objects and seal cracks by filling them in with its matcha powder.\n\nPoltchageist and its evolved form, Sinistcha, are the only known Pokémon that can have Hospitality as an Ability."

Ogerpon (Japanese: オーガポン Ogerpon) is a Grass-type Legendary Pokémon introduced during Generation IX, in The Teal Mask.\n\nWhile it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Ogerpon has four forms, determined by the mask it is wearing, which also changes its type, each with their own unique Terastallized state.\n\nTeal Mask Ogerpon is the game mascot of The Teal Mask, appearing in The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.\n\nIt is associated with the Loyal Three and their leader Pecharunt.\nOgerpon is a predominantly green, humanoid Pokémon. Its green torso is spotted with white flowers and yellow dots, and it is capable of extending green and black vines of ivy. Its long legs are black in the front and white in the back, and its two-toed feet each have two green leaves sprouting between the toes. Its torso is mostly covered by a large, green, multicolored cloak-like structure that extends from a stem on top of its head. This cloak frames its face with a large, black, thorny vine, the two uppermost thorns resembling horns. While the cloak's sleeves move as if Ogerpon has arms beneath them, it actually has no arms or even shoulders; the cloak itself is prehensile and serves as its arms, with the \"sleeves\" able to grasp and manipulate objects. Ogerpon can also extend a prehensile branch and vine from its torso. Ogerpon has an orange face, yellow eyes with white, star-shaped pupils and small green leaves at the edges that loosely resemble eyelashes, a three-pointed leaf that serves as hair, small black markings on its eyebrows and cheeks, and two pointed fangs in its upper jaw. Its face is usually hidden behind one of its masks, and in battle, it wields a large, spiky cudgel wrapped in ivy; these tools are stored under its cloak when not in use. Ogerpon is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\n\nOgerpon is a very intelligent Pokémon with a playful mischief-loving side. It's full of curiosity about the lives of people and other Pokémon, usually spending time with humans while wearing a mask to blend in with them in Kitakami's Festival of Masks. Usually causing trouble, such as by stealing snacks from the village’s food supply or making off with items that caught its eye. It fights by confusing its opponents with its nimble movements and kicks, and it draws type-based energy from its masks, imbuing its cudgel with different elements. Ogerpon becomes weaker if its masks are taken away, and its full power can be restored to it by returning its masks. By using any of its masks, Ogerpon is capable of Terastallizing itself without the need of a Tera Orb, supposedly due to the masks being made of Tera crystals, just like Tera Orbs. This species is known to have a very long lifespan; one specimen is confirmed to have been alive for hundreds of years. Ogerpon is mortal enemies with the Loyal Three and their leader Pecharunt, mainly due to the group's actions towards it in the past. In Kitakami myths, it is described as \"the ogre\".\n\nOgerpon is the only known Pokémon capable of using the move Ivy Cudgel. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Embody Aspect as an Ability in any of its Terastallized states."

    "solution": "This is archaludon, and is a Steel/Dragon-type Pokemon. Archaludon (Japanese: ブリジュラス Briduras) is a dual-type Steel/Dragon Pokémon introduced during Generation IX, in The Indigo Disk.\n\nIt evolves from Duraludon when exposed to a hunk of Metal Alloy.\nArchaludon is a tall, metallic, bipedal dinosaur-like Pokémon with an angular, cuboid body bent at its chest and hips. Its body is primarily cool gray, although it has dark blue colorations on its palms and soles, as well as dark blue platings on its face and underside. The underside plating has criss-crossing patterns on the torso, and two red stripes at the bottom, with three small notches on each of them. This plating extends past Archaludon's head at the sides, forming horn-like features tipped with red. There is a continuous protrusion running the length of Archaludon's spine, three pairs of zigzag patterns on its sides, and spikes on the back of its head and the tip of its large tail.\n\nArchaludon's head is small compared to its body and is sunken into its neck. The plating on its face is T-shaped with a few indents on the sides, and folds down the middle to partially cover its yellow eyes. Its mouth, shaped into a permanent scowl, opens at the upper jaw and contains a grooved copper-colored tube, which it uses to fire beams to attack. When it closes its mouth, the tube is concealed and resembles teeth.\n\nArchaludon's hands and feet are large and V-shaped, each of which are connected to cuboid forelimbs and have two rectangular digits. On these hands and feet, Archaludon has tall, retractable spires near the joints, with the spires on its feet usually retracted. These spires contain pointed, yellow terminals at their tips, which gather and store static electricity from Archaludon's surroundings, as it is incapable of producing electricity on its own. Similar terminal pairs are found on the spikes on Archaludon's head and tail.\n\nWhen Archaludon faces danger, it will get down on all fours, straighten its body, retract its limbs, and fully extend the spires on its hands and feet, forming a shape that resembles a steel bridge. This position allows for less mobility but offers Archaludon a sturdier center of gravity. In this position, Archaludon is capable of using the static electricity stored in its terminals to fire a tremendously powerful beam of electric energy. When Archaludon charges up to fire this beam, electrical energy connects the terminals on its head, tail, and limbs, in a similar fashion to bridge suspension cables. During storms and other inclement weather, Archaludon's terminals can gather static electricity more easily, allowing it to fire off its beam much faster. Archaludon's defensive capabilities are so strong that it cannot be fazed by a cave-in. Archaludon often digs holes in the mountains while searching for food.\n\nArchaludon and its pre-evolved form, Duraludon, are the only known Pokémon that can have Stalwart as an Ability. Additionally, Archaludon is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Electro Shot."

Each syrpent has green, leaf-shaped eyestalks with yellow eyes; a long green body with a pale yellow underbelly; and a tail tipped with leafy green ornaments.\n\nThree of the seven syrpents are always visible outside of the syrup apple: the central syrpent, which is the dominant entity in the system, rises from the center of the apple; and two of the syrpents' tails emerge from its rear. The central syrpent has the longest body and is further distinguished by its two horns. The left horn has an apple impaled on it, which appears to be the same apple that the Pokémon inhabited when it was an Applin. The four other syrpents composing Hydrapple are usually hidden within the syrup, with only the tops of their closed eyestalks visible from without. Sometimes, the four hidden syrpents emerge from the syrup so that five of Hydrapple's heads are visible. To move, Hydrapple's two tail syrpents work together to push its entire body across the ground.\n\nThe seven syrpents that form Hydrapple have inconstant and fickle temperaments, and rarely work together as a team. On the rare occasion that the syrpents' moods align, Hydrapple unleashes its full power.\n\nHydrapple and its pre-Evolution Dipplin, are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Syrup Bomb and the only known Pokémon that can have Supersweet Syrup as an Ability.

    "solution": "This is terapagos, and is a Normal-type Pokemon. Terapagos (Japanese: テラパゴス Terapagos) is a Normal-type Legendary Pokémon introduced during Generation IX, in The Indigo Disk.\n\nWhile it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Terapagos has three forms: its Normal Form, its Terastal Form, and a unique Stellar-type Terastallized state referred to as its Stellar Form. When it enters a battle, it changes from its Normal Form into its Terastal Form through its Tera Shift Ability, and transforms from its Terastal Form into its Stellar Form upon Terastallizing.\n\nTerastal Form Terapagos is the game mascot of The Indigo Disk, appearing in The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.\n\nTerapagos plays an important role in Pokémon Horizons: The Series.\nNormal Form Terapagos is a small reptilian Pokémon that resembles an indigo tortoise. Its head, legs, and tail stem from a cyan, hexagonal shell with the Terastal symbol on its back: a white hexagon with triangular extensions on each corner that connects it to the edges of its back. Its neck and legs each have a cyan four-pointed star and ring rub on them. Its feet each have three toes, and its tail has a cyan four-pointed star at its tip. It has two light blue eyes with rouge rimming and four-pointed star-shaped pupils. It has a diamond-like pattern on its forehead and two diamonds hanging like earrings on both sides of its head. Lastly, it has a \"ponytail\" made up of three segments of diamond-like shapes. The segments reduce in size as they get farther from the head and gain a purplish tint to them.\n\nNormal Form Terapagos is said to have a splendid aura. It is a small and particularly weak Pokémon; for that reason, it can assume a dormant state whenever its life is put in danger or it needs to hibernate, pulling its head, limbs, and tail into its shell and shrinking in size, which makes itself look like an ordinary jewel. It also has the ability to crystallize the energy in its own body to form a green, protective barrier around itself if necessary, even in its dormant state. Through this same ability, Terapagos causes glowing, hard crystals to form around it, even in its dormant state, which gave Area Zero its distinctive appearance. As depicted in Pokémon Horizons: The Series, like other turtles, Terapagos is unable to move if it is turned upside down, needing outside help to stand back up. It has shown to have an incredibly long lifespan, with one known to have lived for millions of years while slumbering within its shell.\n\nTerapagos is responsible for the Terastal phenomenon. Terapagos inhabited the Paldea region in a bygone era. It was thought that this species went extinct, with it said to have been caught up in seismic shifts that occurred about 2,000,000 years ago. However, one of them managed to survive by crystallizing its own body and going into hibernation in the Area Zero Underdepths, where it laid low until the present day. According to Briar, Terapagos is made of Terastal energy. Heath is the one who discovered Terapagos and coined its name. With the power of its crystals, Terapagos can bombard its foes with star-shaped projectiles. In The Approaching Shadow!, Spinel claims that Terapagos and Laquium are polar opposites. In HZ082, it was shown absorbing the energy of the crystals in Area Zero to power up. In HZ087, it was also shown gathering its allies' power into itself to power up as well.\n\nTerapagos also has the ability to alter timelines in some capacity, as seen in the core series games and animated series. It is capable of bringing humans, certain Pokémon, and objects forward from other points in time or from alernate timelines altogether. While using this ability, a mist appears around the affected area; once it disappears, whatever was brought is sent back. As seen in several Pokémon Horizons episodes, Terapagos also has the ability to create visions of its own memories. Due to the Terastal energy its body produces, Terapagos was responsible for allowing advanced technologies, such as Tera Orbs, the professor's AI duplicate, and the \"time machine\" to exist in spite of human limitations. Tera Orbs directly exposed to the energy from Terapagos will gain the ability to Terastallize Pokémon without the need to recharge. Terapagos also has a strong connection to the Stellar type.\n\nTerapagos is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Tera Starstorm. Its Normal Form is also the only known Pokémon that can have Tera Shift as its Ability."

Pecharunt (Japanese: モモワロウ Momowarou) is a dual-type Poison/Ghost Mythical Pokémon introduced during Generation IX, in The Indigo Disk (though it was not made available until the release of Mochi Mayhem).\n\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\n\nIt is the leader of the Loyal Three, and is associated with Ogerpon.\nPecharunt is a small Pokémon resembling a piece of mochi. It has two forms it can take both inside and outside of battle. The first form resembles an upside-down peach, with a black circular face at the center and a thin, vertical line splitting its body into two halves. In its face are two white semicircle eyes, appearing to be frowning. It takes its second form upon opening up, revealing a smaller inner body resembling a peach's pit. It has a darker purple and pink body with two white eyes which are usually frowning, below which is a white, ribbon-shaped mouth. On its head rests two purple flaps and a scorpion-like ponytail. It has two heart-shaped paws at the bottom of its body, along with three black dots on each side underneath them. The discarded shell floats on both sides of Pecharunt, forming spiky wing-like appendages. The inside of these shells have a bright pink glow, outlined in black. The bright pink extends slightly through the black outline in six thin lines. The chains have a magenta color to them and are divided in identical segments, ending in a slightly larger segment with two protrusions, making it resemble the shape of Pecharunt's shell.\n\nPecharunt stores poison in its peach-shaped shell and uses it to create toxic chains and roll up poisonous Binding Mochi, which are stored in its shell until they are needed. It is able to use its toxic chains in combat, badly poisoning its enemies in the process. The chains are also capable of empowering other Pokémon, using its toxins to enhance certain aspects of their bodies, such as their muscles, brain, or looks, as seen with Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti, respectively. It serves its mochi to Pokémon and humans, but may also shoot them at their mouths if necessary. The mochi draw out their deepest desires and powers, but the ones who eat it become chained to Pecharunt's will, as seen with its caretakers, who had their greed drawn out. In some cases, the ones that eat it may completely fall under its control, as seen with Mossui Town's residents and the player's friends from Paldea.\n\nAccording to the player, Pecharunt smells incredibly sweet. It is known to feign weakness by weeping, and acting like a baby in order to gain sympathy from others. Pecharunt can retreat into its shell and remain dormant for years. After being knocked out in Kitakami, it started being known as the \"Never-Rotting Peach\" due to its peach-like shell.\n\nHumans under Pecharunt's control have purple eyes and are surrounded by a purple aura. It can even command humans and Pokémon to fight for it in battles, capable of controlling many beings at once. It relies on others to fight for it due to its cowardly personality and size. However, Pecharunt will fight back if it is has no other option. Capturing Pecharunt will free those under its control with no memories of being controlled.\n\nPecharunt is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Malignant Chain. It is also the only known Pokémon that can have Poison Puppeteer as an Ability."
